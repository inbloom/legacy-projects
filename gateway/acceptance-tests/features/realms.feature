Feature:
  As an application
  In order to allow the end-user to select a realm
  I need to get the list of realms from the gateway

#Scenario: An application calls the Gateway API to get the list of realms
#  When I GET the realms resource
#  Then I get a list of realms
#   And each realm has an "identifier" and a "name"
