Feature:
  As an application provider
  In order to integrate with the inBloom Secure Data Service
  I need to register my application

#Scenario: Application providers are not allowed to get a list of applications
#  When I GET the applications resource
#  Then the response status should be 405 Method Not Allowed
#
#Scenario: Application providers can create new applications
#   When I POST a new application
#   Then I can GET that application
