# This model is used to encapsulate our paging information that the Api
# gives us so that we can more easily do paging in our entities_controller.
# It should be noted that we only ever page forward and never page back, so
# the logic for getting the previous won't work.

  # offset to pass to the API.

  # which will then in turn look for the +Link+ header and try to pull out the
