these instructions only cover the tool setup for running the core services

once these steps are complete, you should have operational system for running the datastore application on OSX

first off, install xcode from the AppStore (5.0.1 has ide problems but shouldn't be a problem for command line needs)

install homebrew: 
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"


##FOR JAVA 7 (if you are running the project under java 7) 
install java 7
set $JAVA_HOME to point to the Home dir of the new jvm

it's a good idea to always run...
$ brew update
...to update formulas before installing. this keeps things sane 

(as a side note but rather important - if you are developing in the sli project and running a local jetty target,
make sure to install jetty8 because the project is using jdk 1.6)
$ brew install jetty8

should you get a "No available formula for jetty8" error go here:

and follow tschundeee's advice

install rvm with ruby 2.0.0: 
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=2.0.0

switch to 2.0.0: 
$ rvm --default use 2.0.0

check your gems
$ gem list

if you get a squirrely message about libyaml
$ rvm pkg install libyaml

it'll bitch about deprecated. whatevs.
$ rvm uninstall all
$ rvm install 2.0.0
an alternative is to use clang for compilation
$ rvm install 2.0.0 --with-gcc=clang 

make sure we are all good, no nasty messages or warnings
$ ruby -v
$ gem list

install mongodb
$ brew install mongodb
(/usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.4.7)

install activemq
$ brew install apache-activemq
(/usr/local/Cellar/activemq/5.8.0) don't forget to modify activemq.xml!!

install maven
$ brew install maven
(/usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.1.1)

install ant
$ brew install ant
(/usr/local/Cellar/ant/1.9.2)

modify /etc/profile to include the MAVEN_OPTS and SLI_ROOT env variables from the Readme
$ sudo nano /etc/profile

this will get you far enough to build and run all of the core services...however...a gem dependency in the rails apps (therubyracer) will fail so do this
$ gem install libv8
$ gem install therubyracer

you will need to modify the Gemfile.lock and comment out the references to libv8 and therubyracer with a "#". 

Alternatively, you may be able to get therubyracer installed by following instructions at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19630154/gem-install-therubyracer-v-0-10-2-on-osx-mavericks-not-installing
