    <title>Install a REST Client and Establish a Session</title>

    <para>
        After you register your applicaion, you can install a REST client in 
        your browser of choice. See documentation for your selected REST 
        client for details about installing and using it.
    </para>
    <para> No matter which client you use, one of the first things you'll need to do is obtain and
        OAuth token of a user with permission to access content in the &COMPANYABBR; Secure Data
        Services. Chances are that as you develop your application, you'll use multiple sample user
        accounts to test how your application handles different users with different permissions.
        Note that only one of those accounts can have an active session with the &RESTAPI; from a
        given browser at a given time. </para>
    <para>
        Select which sample user account you want to start with, then create an 
        OAuth token using that user account's credentials.
        <!-- FIXME... how? Need brief instructions! -->
    </para>
    <para> Once you have an authentication token, be prepared to provide it as part of the HTTP
        headers for each REST API call. In the REST client, focus on the
        <guilabel>Accept</guilabel>, <guilabel>Content-Type</guilabel>, and
            <guilabel>Authorization</guilabel> headers. For each request, use the header combination
        shown below that corresponds to the language/notation you've selected for that request (JSON
        or XML): </para>
    <para>
        Headers for a JSON request:
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
Accept: application/vnd.slc+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.slc+json
Authorization: bearer oauth_token*
                ]]></programlisting>
    <para>
        Header for an XML request:
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
Accept: application/vnd.slc+xml
Content-Type: application/vnd.slc+xml
Authorization: bearer oauth_token*
                ]]></programlisting>
    <para>
        * <guilabel>oauth_token</guilabel> = the OAuth token generated upon
        authentication that represents the crendentials of a text user
    </para>
    <para>
        In the REST client, confirm your session by sending a request to the
        <classname>home</classname> resource. Form the GET request below
        in your REST client, and don't forget to add the headers as indicated
        above.
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
GET $BASE_URL/api/rest/v1.1/home
            ]]></programlisting>
    <para>
        If the API responds with <code>200 OK</code>, it means that you have 
        established an authorized session on behalf of your sample user. 
        The response body for this request to <classname>home</classname>
        includes the HATEOAS links of all "reachable" URIs for the current
        user. The following is an example of such a response body (in JSON):

    <para> After you have a functioning test environment and a working knowledge of the business
        domain and the API, you can form URIs and test them in your REST client. The sections that
        follow cover the basics on how to select a resource and form HTTP requests (URI patterns).
        Use these basics along with the list of resources in <xref linkend="rest_api_resources"
        />, as you form each new request and as you program your application to make those same
        requests. </para>
