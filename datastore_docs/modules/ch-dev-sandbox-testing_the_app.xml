    <title>Testing Your Application in the Sandbox</title>
    
    <para>You can log in to the Sandbox as a test user from the sample data set you added using the
        procedure <xref linkend="doc-f6fa6643-0616-4a70-8172-86a000fc4da3"/>. When you log in as a
        test user, you can use your application as if your were a user who has the role and
        permissions of the test user. </para>
    <para>The &PRODUCTABBR;-provided small and medium datasets provide test users with common
        &PRODUCTABBR; roles, as described in <xref
            linkend="doc-3e1677bd-a02f-44a0-9c73-4eaaa1e1b064"/>. If you are using a custom dataset
        that contains a role not included in the default roles, you can define the custom role's
        permissions. See <xref linkend="doc-d6c53933-f760-494d-a52e-e1c68513eda2"/> for more
        information about defining custom roles.</para>

    <para> During development, you can also examine what data a test user has access to. To do this,
        sign in to the Sandbox as described above, then use the Dashboard application to explore
        student, parent, teacher, and other educational data in the data store. </para>

        <title>Why User Role Selection is Necessary for Testing</title>
        <para> When you log in to &PRODUCTABBR; as an application developer, the &PRODUCTABBR;
            identity provider (IDP) determines the rights you have upon signing in. If you were
            signing in as a user from the data store, though, it would be the education
            organization's IDP, not &PRODUCTABBR;, that determines your user roles and rights. In
            Production, operators configure &PRODUCTABBR; to authenticate users from those IDPs. In
            the Sandbox, though, you don't have that IDP connection to authenticate with. Instead,
            you must select which role you want the user to take upon signing in. &PRODUCTABBR;
            assigns the role for your test user based on this selection. That role is only good for
            that session. </para>
