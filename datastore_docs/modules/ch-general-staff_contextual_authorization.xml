            <emphasis>If a Staff (user entity) is associated with a 
                certain educationOrganization, then the user has the context 
                necessary to access all the data within or below that
                educationOrganization in the educationOrganization hierarchy, 
                if a hierarchy exists.

        <para>
            Staff can access data within their own education organization, and 
            within any education organization that falls under that organization
            in the hierarchy. The diagram below demonstrates this context 
            relationship between users and education organizations.

            Staff cannot access data for students that are not enrolled in 
            a school once the grace period for data access has expired. For 
            example, if Jimmy was not enrolled in Daybreak High for the last 
            3 months, and the grace period is 2 months, then the principal 
            of Daybreak High cannot access Jimmy's data. If the grace period 
            is 4 months, though, the principal can access Jimmy's data.
