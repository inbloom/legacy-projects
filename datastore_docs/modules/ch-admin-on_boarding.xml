    <title>On-boarding Districts </title>
    
    <para>
        On-boarding is the process of setting up your district to 
        use &PRODUCTABBR;. The on-boarding process involves setting 
        up user accounts, ingesting data for your district into
        the &PRODUCTABBR; Data Store, and (if applicable) enabling 
        applications to access the data you have ingested.
    </para>
    <para>
        Most districts will on-board using the process described in
        <xref linkend="doc-bb5b1c66-92a2-4101-a495-ade0e991b585"/>.

                    this zip file must not contain any folders and 
                    should only contain those three files.
