    <title>Add Data to the Sandbox</title>

    <para> 
        In order to make the most of your development work, you will 
        need data to test with. This section describes how to import 
        data to your Sandbox tenancy, a process &COMPANYABBR; calls
        <glossterm linkend="def-data_ingestion">data ingestion</glossterm>.

    <warning>
        <title>Caution: Do not put real data in your sandbox!</title>
        <para>
            The inBloom Sandbox MUST NOT contain real data, 
            particularly personally identifiable information (PII)
            or education records for real students and educators. 
            Make sure to use only artificial or fabricated data in
            your sandbox. For your convenience, inBloom provides 
            fabricated sample data sets that you can select and load 
            into your sandbox.

    <para>
        Before you ingest data to your Sandbox, you must choose what 
        type of data you want to ingest. &COMPANYABBR; gives you the

    <para>Developers can import multiple data sets into a tenancy. For example, you can add both the
        &PRODUCTABBR;-provided small and medium data sets. However, it is important that the
        information in each data set be unique and not overlap with other previously added data. If
        you load conflicting data, the old data will be overwritten with the new and the dataset
        could become unstable. The small and medium dataset do not contain overlapping data.</para>
    <para>Once data is added, all developers with access to the tenancy can access and test with the
        data.</para>
