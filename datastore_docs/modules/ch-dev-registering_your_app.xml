    <title>Registering Your Application in Production</title>  
    
    <para>Each application, whether in a Sandbox or in Production, must have credentials to
        authenticate with &PRODUCTABBR; in order to use &PRODUCTABBR; resources. These credentials
        include a client ID and shared secret, which are passed when making authorization calls from
        your application to &PRODUCTABBR;. This applies to all applications that call the &RESTAPI;,
        including both web applications and standalone applications (such as mobile apps). </para>
    <para> &PRODUCTABBR; creates these credentials (client ID and shared secret) for your
        application as part of the application registration process. As an application developer,
        you initiate the application registration process. </para>
    <para>In the Sandbox, your registration is automatically approved, and your credentials are
        available immediately. The application registration process for Sandbox is covered in <xref
            linkend="doc-909557d4-cf76-4144-8201-3f643664fb25"/>. </para>
    <para>In Production, you'll have to wait for approval from an &OPERATORROLE;. </para>

        <title>Registering New Applications for &PRODUCTABBR;</title>
        <para>
            The Register Application system tool provides an interface for
            registering applications for use by education organizations in 
            your &PRODUCTABBR; deployment. As an administrator, you'll use
            this tool to request registration for a web or mobile application
            that isn't already available in your &PRODUCTABBR;.
        </para>
        <para> Use the following steps to register a new application in the Sandbox: </para>

                <para>
                    If your application is a web application, start by 
                    deploying the application on a web server and establishing
                    its persistent URL for users to access. You'll need this 
                    URL for your application registration form.

                <para> Look for an email from an &OPERATORROLE; confirming that the application
                    registration request was approved. Save this email so that you don't lose its
                    important information. This step may take several hours to a couple of days
                    depending on your &OPERATORROLE;s' protocol. Contact an &OPERATORROLE; for that
                    &PRODUCTABBR; deployment to track your request. </para>

                    Return to the register application system tool and

                    client ID and shared secret values at the top of the page. 
                    Copy these values and update the configuration values in
                    your application to use them when authenticating with
                    &PRODUCTABBR; (making OAuth authorization calls).

                <para> Enable the new application for one or more of the education organizations
                    shown. This allows organizations using &PRODUCTABBR; to use your application for
                    their interactions with the &PRODUCTABBR; Secure Data Service. </para>
