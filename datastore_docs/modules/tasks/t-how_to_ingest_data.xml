    <title>How to Ingest Data</title>
    
    <para>
        To ingest data, you upload files using an FTP client to the a 
        landing zone configured for the realm you are ingesting data for. 
        The requirements for ingestion are: 
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para> 
                The FTP hostname associated with the target landing zone,
                configured and communicated by an &PRODUCTABBR; administrator
                for the corresponding tenancy.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                An FTP client installed on your local system to use for 
                file transfers using SFTP.
            </para>

                User credentials as an &PRODUCTABBR; 
                <glossterm linkend="def-ingestion_user">Ingestion User</glossterm>,
                also created by an &PRODUCTABBR; administrator for the 
                corresponding tenancy.

                The files to ingest, prepared as described in
                <xref linkend="t-how_to_prepare_data_for_ingestion"/>.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        With all this information and data at hand, use the following steps
        to ingest data:
    </para>
    <procedure>
        <step>
            <para>
                Configure the FTP client to connect to the landing zone
                (FTP host and SFTP/SSH port) using the ingestion user
                credentials (normal authentication).
            </para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>
                Connect to the landing zone using that configured connection.
            </para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>
                Upload one or more .zip archive files that have been prepared
                for ingestion.
            </para>
        </step>
        <step>
            <para>
                Monitor the landing zone file list from within the FTP client.
                When an ingestion job is complete, download and view the log 
                files to determine the status of that job. For more about
                the log files and how to understand their contents, see
                <xref linkend="c-ingestion_logs"/>.
            </para>
        </step>
    </procedure>
    <caution>
        <para>
            When ingesting data, take care that you ingest to your 
            education organization only. As of this writing, ingestion 
            users have the ability to ingest data to any education 
            organizations within their specific tenants. This can lead to 
            ingestion collisions between education organizations.
