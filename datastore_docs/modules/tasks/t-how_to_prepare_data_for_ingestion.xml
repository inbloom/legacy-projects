    <title>How to Prepare Data for Ingestion</title>
    
    <para>
        Data is ingested from a .zip archive file containing one control file 
        and one or more XML data files. Data ingestion operations for 
        &PRODUCTABBR; require that the data files are compliant with the 
        ingestion schema described in &PRODUCTABBR; ingestion documentation.

                    The top-level education organization in the 
                    data files, typically a state education agency (SEA),
                    must match the education organization defined 
                    when the landing zone was created

            Assemble these files using your preferred processing and editing
            tools. In most cases, data conversion is necessary to ensure the
            data is in the right XML schema. &COMPANYABBR; provides assistance
            to on-board education organizations, including facilitating the
            conversion of data in preparation for ingestion.

        <para>
            For use in validating content throughout the ingestion process,
            &COMPANYABBR; publishes the ingestion XSDs. While preparing
            data, you can use your preferred XML validation tools to validate
            against these XSDs. You may also find the open source
            validation tool useful, as described in
            <xref linkend="c-ingestion-offline_validation_tool"/>.

            After preparing the data XML files, as described in
            <xref linkend="t-prepare_data_for_ingestion-data_files"/>,
            create a text file to serve as the control file for an ingestion
            job. Name the file using the ".ctl" extension. In your preferred 
            text editor, add lines to the control file using 
            <xref linkend="r-ingestion_control_file_format"/> as a guide.
        </para>
        <para>
            There should be one control file for each ingestion job, and a job
            corresponds to a single .zip archive uploaded to the landing zone.
            Be sure there is a line in the control file for each XML data file
            included in the same job (same .zip archive), and that there are 
            no lines for files that are not in the job.
