    <para>Besides knowing the data store's logical model, you should also know how &COMPANYABBR; has
        modeled its developer resources. The sections that follow give you a brief look at the tools
        &COMPANYABBR; provides for &PRODUCT; development. </para>

                    <emphasis role="bold">&PRODUCTABBR; Sandbox</emphasis> is a self-contained
                    &PRODUCTABBR; instance designed for developing application prototypes and
                    testing them against &PRODUCTABBR; APIs and features. The Sandbox mimics the
                    &PRODUCTABBR; Production environment, while providing features that support
                    application development. Since the Sandbox is completely isolated from
                    Production, you can try out ideas and develop systems without impacting the
                    &PRODUCTABBR; Secure Data Service, applications, or services. The Sandbox terms
                    of use prohibit the use of PII data within the Sandbox environment. </para>

                    instance of &PRODUCTABBR;. It hosts real, live data and gives you an accurate
                    look at how the application works for selected users. Developers can access
                    Production using the &PRODUCTABBR; App Developers realm.</para>

        <para>&COMPANYABBR; provides a unified account experience for developers. A developer
            registers for an account in the Sandbox and can then use the same account credentials to
            log into the &PRODUCTABBR; App Developer realm in Production. The permissions available
            to developers vary depending on the type of environment the developer is logged in to.
            While developers can access Production to register their applications, it is expected
            that the Sandbox will be used for the bulk of application testing and development. </para>

        <title>Developer Collaboration in the Sandbox</title>
        <para>When you register for a Sandbox account, you are assigned your own tenancy. The
            tenancy exists as a boundary for data and registered applications. You can create new
            developer accounts within your tenancy, which grants these developers access to all of
            your data and applications, but you cannot give an existing developer accounts access to
            your tenancy.</para>
        <para>Any changes a developer makes to data or applications within a tenancy effects all
            developers within that tenancy. For example, if one developer adds a custom dataset, all
            other developers within that tenancy will be able to use it. If the custom dataset
            contains data that overlaps other data that already existed in the data store, then the
            original data is overwritten. </para>
        <para>Changes to applications, such as a change to an application name or disabling an
            application for an EdOrg, also effect all developers. Therefore, it is recommended that
