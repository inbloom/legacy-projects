    <para>
        &PRODUCTABBR; uses a data interchange schema that corresponds to the 
        Ed-Fi v1.0.03 schema. However, &COMPANYABBR; has modified this schema 
        using schema extensions and restrictions. To make sure that your data 
        can be ingested, please make sure it conforms to the Ed-Fi v1.0.03 
        schema as well as the &PRODUCTABBR; extension schema. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
        You can download the &PRODUCTABBR; extension schema at: 
        <link xlink:show="new" xlink:href="xsd/SLI-Ed-Fi-Core.xsd">SLI Extension Schema</link>.</para>
    
    <caution>
        <para>
            The term "schema" is used to describe both the interchange schema
            for ingestion and the database schema for the &COMPANYABBR; 
            Data Store. The REST API interacts with data based on the schema 
            in the data store, not the interchange schema. Version numbers 
            of these schemas may not be synchronized. See developer
            documentation for more information about the API and data store.
