                Deleting a record (expressed as an element instance in XML) 
                does not trigger a cascade action: any other records 
                referring to the target record remain unchanged in the 
                data store.

                If a deleted record has referring ("child") data, that data
                is orphaned in the database except in the cases listed
                below.

                When force deleting an education organization, student data 
                that has an association to it remains unchanged. That 
                association is removed if the
                <varname>studentSchoolAssociation</varname> that includes
                the deleted education organization in its parent hierarchy
                is also deleted with a forced delete action.
