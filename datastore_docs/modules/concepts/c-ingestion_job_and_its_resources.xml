    <title>Ingestion Job and its Resources</title>
    
    <para>
        A single ingestion job corresponds to the .zip archive uploaded to
        a tenant's landing zone. When &PRODUCTABBR; begins processing a new
        ingestion job, it assigns it a unique identifier, called its
        job ID. The job ID contains the name of the ingested file and an 
        epoch time string.  
    </para>
    <para>
        The XML data files within each .zip file are resources processed as
        part of the ingestion job. As &PRODUCTABBR; processes each file, it
        identifies it with a resource ID corresponding to its file name.
    </para>
    <para>
        Log files generated by the ingestion system use the job ID and 
        resource ID values in their filenames and content.
    </para>
