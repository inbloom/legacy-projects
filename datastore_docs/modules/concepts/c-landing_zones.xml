    <title>Landing Zones</title>
    
    <para>
        Each tenancy in the &PRODUCTABBR; data store has one or more landing 
        zones that can serve that tenancy. Unlike the &PRODUCTABBR;
        REST API and applications built on it, the landing zone is designed to
        handle a significant amount of data (thousands of records) as part of
        a single operation.
    </para>
    <para>
        From a user's perspective, the landing zone is a secure FTP server 
        used to upload files for data ingestion. Any &PRODUCTABBR; user with 
        the <emphasis>Ingestion User</emphasis> role can use those user 
        credentials to connect to the landing zone and upload files.
    </para>
    <para>
        Under the cover, the landing zone detects newly uploaded files and
        begins the ingestion process. Each file uploaded launches a new 
        ingestion job, and the job ID value contains the name of its
        corresponding .zip file.
    </para>
    <para>
        After handling each ingestion job, the landing zone contains a series 
        of log files with messages that job. The files are named using the job 
        ID and other identifying information. An ingestion user can download
        these files from the same FTP server connection used to upload the
        .zip files. 
    </para>
    <para>
        Ingestion user documentation covers the details on how to form the
        files to upload to the landing zone and how to read and interpret the
        messages in the log files.
