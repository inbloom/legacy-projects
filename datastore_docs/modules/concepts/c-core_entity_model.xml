    <title>&PRODUCTABBR; Core Entity Model</title>
    
    <para>
        The &PRODUCT; Core Entity Model (CEM) is based on the Ed-Fi Unifying 
        Data Model. &PRODUCT; maintains a one-to-one mapping between the two 
        models for the majority of the entities. However, some Ed-Fi entities 
        have been merged into a single entity or split into multiple entities 
        in the &PRODUCTABBR; CEM. 
    </para>
    <para>
        The &COMPANYABBR; data ingestion subsystem, which handles bulk data
        additions and updates to the &COMPANYABBR; data store, uses Ed-Fi XML 
        schemas as the primary format for the source data. To handle the
        differences between the &COMPANYABBR; CEM and the Ed-Fi data model,
        &COMPANYABBR; provides an Ed-Fi XML schema extension.
    </para>
    <para>
        Deviations from Ed-Fi, and the entity-level mapping between the
        &COMPANYABBR; CEM and the Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model, are published in
        &PRODUCTABBR; ingestion documentation.
