    <title>How New Tenancies Get Started</title>
    
    <para>
        &PRODUCTABBR; identifies state and local education agencies as
        different tenancies. Each 
        <glossterm linkend="def-tenant">tenant</glossterm> has access to its
        own set of data, and the same &PRODUCTABBR; data store can serve
        multiple tenancies. In most cases, there exists a hierarchy of
        tenancies served by the same data store: the state
        <glossterm linkend="def-education_organization">education organizations</glossterm>
        and the local levels below it (district, county, city, etc.).
    </para>
    <para>
        When a new tenancy comes on board with &COMPANYABBR;, an existing
        administrator for that &PRODUCTABBR; deployment must create the new
        tenancy using administration tools. This process is covered in 
        &PRODUCTABBR; administrator documentation. 
    </para>
    <para>
        Part of on-boarding a new tenancy, the administrator must, at a minimum, 
        create an administrator account that serves that tenancy. Then, either
        that new administrator or another authoritative administrator must 
        create the following for that tenancy
        a <glossterm linkend="def-landing_zone">landing zone</glossterm>
        and one or more users with the Ingestion User role. 
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                A <glossterm linkend="def-landing_zone">landing zone</glossterm>,
                which is a group of resources allocated to ingesting data for
                the tenancy.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                One or more &PRODUCTABBR; user accounts with the 
                <emphasis>Ingestion User</emphasis> role. If you are ingesting
                data, you must use the credentials of one of these accounts.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        With the administrators, landing zones, and ingestion users in place,
        a tenancy can ingest its first set of data to the &PRODUCTABBR; data
        store and, afterward, begin regular use of &PRODUCT;.
