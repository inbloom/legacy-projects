    <title>Bulk Extract Error Reporting</title>
    
    <para>
        Basic error reporting metrics are captured during the creation 
        of the bulk extract data files. In the same directory as the 
        data files, <filename>error.txt</filename> is created to
        report errors that occurred during bulk extraction. 
    </para> 
    <para>
        The <filename>error.txt</filename> file indicates that errors 
        occurred during the process, and the latest successful full 
        extract should be obtained. A list is included to provide 
        more specific information about the type of errors that were 
        encountered. The file lists the number of errors that occurred 
        per entity type.
