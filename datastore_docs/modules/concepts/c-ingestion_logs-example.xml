    <para>
        Consider an ingestion job submitted as a single zip file named 
        <filename>grade12Math.zip</filename> with two data files, 
        <filename>Grade_12_Math_CCS_G_C.xml</filename> and 
        <filename>Grade_12_Math_CCS_G_SRT.xml</filename>. 
    </para>
    <para>
        The job-level log file for this example is named 
        <filename>job-grade12Math.zip-1335552611336-f2ff0a92-c5ba-4aa1-8f28-e52618d35bae.log</filename> 
        and contains the following "INFO" lines:

    <para>
        Records that fail XSD validation are not considered for processing 
        and produce corresponding error files. Only records that pass XSD 
        validation are considered for processing. If those records fail later 
        on during processing they are reported as "records failed processing"
        and produce corresponding error files.
    </para>
    <para>
        If the job produces any warnings or errors, they will be placed in 
        the job-level files 
       <filename> job_warn-grade12Math.zip-1335552611336-f2ff0a92-c5ba-4aa1-8f28-e52618d35bae.log</filename>
