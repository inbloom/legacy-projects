    <title>Ingestion Logs</title>
    
    <para>
        When &PRODUCTABBR; processes an ingestion job, it creates several log 
        files and places those files in the landing zone, accessible for
        download from the same FTP server used to upload the job. These files
        contain the warnings and errors that occur both at job level (for 
        each control file) and at resource level (for each XML file). 
        See <xref linkend="r-ingestion_log_files"/> for a description of
        these log files.
    </para>
    <para>
        The file names and contents for each log file use the job ID and 
        resource ID values. Within the files, each new log file entry begins 
        with INFO, WARN, or ERROR to indicate the type of message.
        See <xref linkend="r-ingestion_errors_and_warnings"/> for a complete
        list of messages along with hints on how to handle them.

        <para>
            Error messages imply that the ingestion of the specified data 
            has failed, either as a whole or in part. To complete a successful 
            ingestion, you must resolve these errors.
