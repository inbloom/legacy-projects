        <title>Ed-Fi Core Schema</title>
        <para>
            The structure of the &PRODUCT; data store is organized based on 
            the Ed-Fi Core standard. Ed-Fi Core was created as a unifying 
            logical data model for educational data. The Ed-Fi Core XML 
            schema aligns with the Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) 
            (<link xlink:show="new"  xlink:href="ceds.ed.gov">ceds.ed.gov</link>).
            By aligning with Ed-Fi, the &PRODUCTABBR; ingestion schema also 
            aligns with CEDS.
        </para>
        <para>
            The inBloom ingestion schema currently conforms to Ed-Fi Core 
            version &EDFIVERSION;. The XML schema describing it is available 
            for download from 
            <link xlink:href="&EDFISCHEMALINK;">ed-fi.org</link>.

        <para>
            Interchange schemas define XML representations of 
            particular data spaces for transport between systems. From an
            XML perspective, an interchange is a group of entities and 
            associations. Different interchange schemas may be used to
            reflect different use cases.
        </para>
        <para>
            &PRODUCTABBR; interchange schemas are largely based on the
            Ed-Fi interchange schemas. &PRODUCTABBR; covers most, but not all,
            entities in the Ed-Fi Core standard. &PRODUCTABBR; consolidates
            some of the Ed-Fi entities for the sake of scalability and
            performance, both for bulk data ingestion and for data interaction
            using the REST API.
        </para>
        <para>
            The interchange schemas are listed in
            <xref linkend="r-ingestion-entity_interchange_schema_mapping"/>
            along with the entities they map to for both Ed-Fi and
            &INGESTIONSCHEMANAME;.
        </para>
        <para>
            Ingestion users specify these interchanges in the control file 
            when preparing data for ingestion. Look for these interchanges
            as part of the "inBloom ingestion extension schemas" available
            from 
            <link xlink:href="https://inbloom.org/library" xlink:show="new">https://inbloom.org/library</link>.
