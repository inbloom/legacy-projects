    <title>Data Ingestion: Managing Landing Zones</title>
    
    <para>
        The landing zone is a secure FTP server location where you can upload
        files to be ingested to the &PRODUCTABBR; Data Store.
        To create and manage landing zones, you'll need an &PRODUCTABBR;
        administrator account with the
        <glossterm linkend="def-ingestion_user">Ingestion User</glossterm>
        role. 
        <!-- I don't think this is true. I think you need a super admin account,
        not ingestion. According to SH. -->
    </para>
    <note>
        <para>
            Before you can ingest data, you will need 
            to generate secure shell (SSH) keys to authenticate to your landing
            zone. It will be helpful to have these keys generated before you 
            create your landing zone.
        </para>
    </note>
    <para>
        To create landing zones, use the
        <citetitle>Create Landing Zone</citetitle> system tool.

                sure to select the realm for the education organization 
                that you are targeting for data ingestion. The 
                <glossterm linkend="def-state_education_agency">state education agency (SEA)</glossterm>
                associated with that realm must match the SEA for the data you
                intend to ingest.
