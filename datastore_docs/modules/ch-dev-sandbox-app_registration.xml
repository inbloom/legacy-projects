    <title>Registering and Enabling Applications in the Sandbox</title>

    <para> Each application that wants to use &PRODUCTABBR; resources, whether in a Sandbox or in
        Production, must have credentials to authenticate with &PRODUCTABBR;. These credentials
        include a client ID and shared secret, and are passed when making authorization calls from
        your application to &PRODUCTABBR;. This applies to all applications that call the &RESTAPI;,
        including both web applications and standalone applications (such as mobile apps). </para>
    <para> &PRODUCTABBR; creates these credentials (client ID and shared secret) for your
        application as part of the application registration process. As an application developer,
        you initial the application registration process. In the Sandbox, your registration is
        automatically approved, and your credentials are available immediately. In Production,
        you'll have to wait for approval from an&PRODUCTABBR; tenant administrator. The application
        registration process for Production is covered in <xref
            linkend="doc-cb680e76-2e05-4447-a091-ba97bcd5c775"/>. </para>
    <para>After registration, you must enable the application to access data for each EdOrg. The
        available EdOrgs come from the datasets you have added to the Sandbox. Any time you add data
        with a new EdOrg, you will need to enable your application for that EdOrg before you can
        test with users who belong to it. </para>
