    <title>&SDK; Overview</title> 
    
    <para>
        &COMPANYABBR; provides the &SDK; as a convenient option for 
        Java programmers when developing applications that use the &RESTAPI;. 
        This documentation covers setting up and using the Java SDK.
    </para>
    <para>
        Before you can access the SDK, you'll need to do the following:

                Register your application so that you can use in your
                development environment. See

                environment, and see

        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        Note the following values configured or assigned during the application
        registration process. You'll need these when using the SDK:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                <varname>apiURL</varname> - 
                The base URL of where the &RESTAPI; is hosted. The URLs of all 
                REST API requests will be relative to this URL. This will be in
                the form <filename>$BASE_URL/api/rest/v1/</filename>.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                <varname>clientId</varname> -
                A unique ID of the client assigned during application 
                registration. 
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                <varname>clientSecret</varname> -
                A cryptographically secure secret shared between the client and
                the REST API service, assigned alongside the client ID during 
                application registration. 
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                <varname>callbackURL</varname> -
                If you're developing a web application, this is the URL where
                you're currently hosting the application. During development,
                this is likely a persistent test server location that's
                running your application.
