    <title>Sample Application: Java SDK "Hello World"</title>
    <para>
        The sample application is a simple "hello world" type application 
        designed to demonstrate OAuth authentication and SDK usage.

        <para>
            Source for the sample application is included in the distribution 
            under the <filename>sample</filename> directory. The sample 
            application is provided as an Apache Maven project. To build the
            application from this source, run 
            <command>mvn clean package</command> in the root of the 
            distribution. This command will build the 
            <filename>client-api</filename> and sample application.

        <para> Before running the sample application, your application must have access to data in
            an &PRODUCTABBR; Secure Data Service. Use other sections of &PRODUCTABBR; developer
            documentation to determine how to set up your development environment, including adding
