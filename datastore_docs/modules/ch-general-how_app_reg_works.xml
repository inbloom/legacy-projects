    <title>How Application Registration Works</title>
    <para>
        To access &COMPANYABBR; data, applications, and services, 
        applications must meet the following requirements:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para> Must be registered with &COMPANYABBR; </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                Must be authorized for use by each education organization
                that wants to use that application
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        You can ensure an application meets these requirements by following
        the &COMPANYABBR;'s application registration process. This is a
        one-time process that establishes a trusted relationship between 
        the application and a given &COMPANYABBR; deployment.
    </para>
    <para> Your part in the application process will vary based on your role in &COMPANYABBR;: </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para> As an &COMPANYABBR; user, you can only access applications that have been through
                this registration process. Available applications are listed in &COMPANYABBR;. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para> If you're a developer, you must register your application with &COMPANYABBR;,
                then authorize its use by given education organizations. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para> If you are an &PRODUCTABBR; administrator, you can approve and manage the
                applications in the &PRODUCTABBR; Production environment you're administering. </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        The registration process also varies based on the type of application 
        you're registering. Look for references to each of these application 
        types as you step through the registration procedure:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                A <emphasis>web application</emphasis> resides on servers
                accessible over a network connection. A user can interact with
                a web application through a web browser installed on desktop,
                laptop, or mobile device, without installing any part of the 
                application on that device.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para annotations="">
                <emphasis>Installed applications</emphasis> are those that are installed on a
                personal device in which the user (1) is driving the application and (2) has access
                to a web browser on the same device. This would include, but is not limited to,
                applications designed for <trademark>Apple iOS</trademark>,
                    <trademark>Android</trademark>, and desktop operating systems like
                    <trademark>Microsoft Windows</trademark>. </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <!-- Diagram needs updates before it can be included again.
        <para>
            The following diagram shows the creation of a developer/vendor account in both 
            Sandbox and Production. The diagram includes (for both for Sandbox and Production) 
            how an application is created, registered, and enabled for districts for 
            authorization and use by end users.
