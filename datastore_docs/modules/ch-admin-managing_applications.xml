    <para> 
        There are several web applications installed during &PRODUCTABBR; 
        deployment, and additional web and mobile applications can be added 
        at any time. These applications are developed to use &PRODUCTABBR; 
        Services and Data Store. However, an application must be registered
        with your &PRODUCTABBR; deployment before it can use the services 
        in that deployment.
    </para>
    <para> 
        Applications in &PRODUCTABBR; are managed by &OPERATORROLE; as 
        instructed in the &PRODUCTABBR; Runbook. However, SEA or LEA
        Administrators must still enable approved applications
        for an educational organization.
