    <title>Data Ingestion: Uploading Data for Ingestion</title>

    <para>
        Data ingestion starts by making a secure file transfer 
        to a landing zone. To do this, you'll upload files using
        an SFTP client to the a landing zone configured for the
        realm you're ingesting data for. Thus, requirements for
        ingestion are as follows:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                The FTP hostname associated with the 
                landing zone you're targeting. You or another &PRODUCTABBR;
                administrator set this up using the instructions in
                <xref linkend="doc-ae2a0aaf-7960-4272-a5ea-abffb0973e74"/>,
                and the email received after creating the
                landing zone should include the FTP hostname.

                An FTP client to use for file 
                transfers using SFTP.

                The files you want to ingest, compliant 
                with the Ed-Fi v1.0.03 specification. There are a couple of 
                options available to you for creating these files. For details,
                see <xref linkend="doc-6b9d21e0-0d62-4ab7-996d-9b40bccdd422"/>.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                The top-level state education 
                organization (SEA) must match the education organization 
                defined when the landing zone was created.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        After you meet these requirements, 
        you're ready to ingest data. To do this, use your FTP client to upload
        the data files using the SFTP protocol to the landing zone's FTP 
        hostname. Provide normal authentication for the transfer using your 
        &PRODUCTABBR; administrator credentials.

    <!-- Questions to answer in future revisions:
             How do I know what landing zones are available to me?
             How do I track progress for ingestion?
             How do I confirm data has been ingested?
             What errors could occur, and how do I interpret and handle those errors?
