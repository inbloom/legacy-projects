    <title>Sample Code: Data Browser</title>

    <para> The Data Browser in &PRODUCTABBR; is a tool that allows users to explore the data that
        they have access to in the &PRODUCTABBR; Secure Data Service. It includes search and
        navigation functions, and it presents the data in sortable tables. The Data Browser is
        particularly helpful for validating that data has been properly ingested. The data broswer
        is one of the open source applications from &COMPANYABBR;. Developers can use this source as
        a reference when building their own applications for &PRODUCTABBR;. You can download the
        source from the &COMPANYABBR; Github repository: <link xlink:show="new"
            xlink:href="&GITHUBURL;/">&GITHUBURL;/</link>. </para>
    <para>
        The Data Browser was written in Ruby on Rails. It uses a few extra 
        features, such as data tables, to enhance the experience. You can 
        read more documentation by navigating to the application's 
        <filename>doc/app</filename> directory.

        <title>Data Ingestion Prerequisite</title>
        <para>
            To successfully run this application, you must already have data available in the data store. Whether you're working in a developer Sandbox or
            Production, use the instructions provided in your environment's
            setup to configure a landing zone and ingest sample data for use
            by this application.

        <title>Sample Data Browser: Installing</title>
        <para>
            Before you start, make sure that you are currently running 
            Ruby 2.0.0 or higher. Also, make sure that you have Bundler,
            which ships with Rails 3 and may not work for Rails 2.3 and lower.
        </para>
        <procedure>
            <step>
                <para>
                    Navigate to the directory where you installed the 
                    application and run <command>bundle</command> to install
                    the software.

                    Start the Data Browser application by using the command

                    Open the Data Browser application in a web browser to
                    confirm that the URL for the application is working.
                    You will need this URL when registering the application,
                    covered in the next section.

        <title>Sample Data Browser: Registering and Configuring</title>
        <para>
            Register the sample application for use in &PRODUCTABBR; as
            described in 
            <xref linkend="doc-cb680e76-2e05-4447-a091-ba97bcd5c775"/>. 
            To do this, you will need to provide the following two URLs:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    The application URL which is where you're hosting
                    the Data Browser. <!-- For the Data Browser
                    application, the URL follows this syntax
                    where <varname>HOST_ADDRESS</varname> and
                    <varname>PORT</varname> are determined by your
                    Web server's local settings: -->
                </para>
                <!-- <programlisting><![CDATA[http://HOST_ADDRESS:PORT/FIXME]]></programlisting> -->
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    The redirect URL, which is where the browser 
                    redirects after user authentication. For the data
                    browser application, the redirect URL should be the same 
                    as the application URL, but ending with 
                    <filename>/callback</filename>:
                </para>
                <!-- <programlisting><![CDATA[http://HOST_ADDRESS:PORT/FIXME/callback]]></programlisting> -->
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            After registration, you'll receive an email that contains the client
            ID and shared secret generated for your application. Add these two values to the Data Browser's configuration file
            (<filename>config/config.yml</filename> in the data
            browser's application files).
