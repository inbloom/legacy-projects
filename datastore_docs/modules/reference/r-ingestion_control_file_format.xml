    <para>
        The control file defines the set of XML data files to be ingested 
        as part of the same ingestion job. &COMPANYABBR; expects this file to 
        be a text file with a .ctl file extension (such as 
        <filename>control_file.ctl</filename>).
        Within the control file is a series of lines providing information
        about each XML data file, with additional parameters to control
        the ingestion job.

                The file's MD5 hash or checksum for a file may appear as an 
                additional value in each line. This checksum is expressed as 
                32 hexadecimal digits, and it was a required component in
                earlier versions of &PRODUCTABBR;. Now, if it is included in
                the file, it is ignored during ingestion processing.
