    <para>
        All data to be ingested by &PRODUCT; must follow the
        &INGESTIONSCHEMANAME; XML Schema. This schema is based on the 
        Ed-Fi Core Schema (version &EDFIVERSION;) for describing educational 
        data. See <xref linkend="c-ingestion_schemas"/>
        for a general description of the schemas and interchanges.
    </para>
    <para>
        The &INGESTIONSCHEMANAME; XML Schema is published as a series of
        XSD files, compressed into a single .zip archive, available for 
        download from
        <link xlink:href="https://inbloom.org/library" xlink:show="new">https://inbloom.org/library</link>.
        Scroll to the <guilabel>Data Management</guilabel> section and
        click <guibutton>inBloom ingestion extension schemas</guibutton>.

    <para>
        The .zip archive contains the "Core" file and the series of 
        "Interchange" files.

        <para>
            Because of dependencies between entities and attributes in the
            XML data files, you must also follow a series of constraints 
            described in <xref linkend="r-ingestion_constraints"/>.
