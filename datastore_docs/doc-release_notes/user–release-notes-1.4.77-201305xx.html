            <p>
                The following new features were added in this release:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                            <strong>Bulk Extract</strong> - Bulk data extraction through the REST
                            API includes the following new features: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Using the new bulk/extract/tenant resource, a 
                                REST API client can now access data for the tenant
                                associated with the current authenticated user. 
                                For this to work, the current user must have an 
                                inBloom user role that includes the bulk extract 
                                right. REST API documentation covers the new
                                <i>bulk/extract/tenant</i> resource along with 
                                important security and header information 
                                you need to know when using it.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The bulk extract resources now support byte range 
                                requests, which allow REST API clients to resume
                                interrupted downloads. To take advantage of this
                                feature, the client must pass specific HTTP header
                                fields to the call as described in REST API
                                documentation for <i>bulk/extract/tenant</i>.

                                The new bulk/extract/list API resource can be 
                                used to access a list of URLs for the bulk 
                                extract files available to the current user 
                                through the current application. See the API 
                                resources in the inBloom developer 
                                documentation for complete details about 
                                this new resource and how to use it.
                            </p>

                                The bulk extract resources now support adding 
                                a version number in the URI. While having a 
                                version in the URI is supported, the behavior 
                                of the URI is to always use the latest API 
                                version. Operator documentation includes 
                                information on how to refresh bulk extract
                                files when deploying a new version of the 
                                REST API.

                        <li>
                                <p> The Bulk Extract API now supports full extracts for each
                                    top-level education agency. For a local education agency (LEA),
                                    this includes all data associated with a set select entities
                                    listed in the API documentation. For a state education agency
                                    (SEA), this includes public data. The full extracts are created
                                    once per week. A valid user from an education agency can
                                    retrieve the extract for that agency by providing its ID when
                                    calling the API resource
                                        (<i>bulk/extract/{EducationAgencyId}</i>).  All the
                                    available top-level education agency files are listed in the
                                        <i>bulk/extract/list</i> resource.</p>
                            </li>
                        <li>
                            <p> The Bulk Extract API now supports delta extracts at a top level LEA
                                        (<i>bulk/extract/{EducationAgencyId}/delta/{timestamp}</i>).
                                    These extracts are created daily and include information about
                                    data that has been modified or deleted in the period since the
                                    last incremental extract on the previous day. All the available
                                    incremental files are listed in the <i>bulk/extract/list</i>
                                    resource. See the API documentation for additional information
                                    including the current list of supported entities.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The bulk extracts are now encrypted using a 
                                X.509 certificate unique for each application 
                                that is authorized to access the bulk extract 
                                API. The certificate is inspected upon every 
                                API call, then compared to the stored 
                                certificate for the calling application.  
                                If a mismatch is detected, the request is 
                                denied. Each application developer provides 
                                its application's certificate to the inBloom 
                                operator through a non-automated (manual) 
                                process.

                                The bulk extract behavior differs between 
                                sandbox and production environments. In the 
                                inBloom Sandbox, making bulk extract API calls 
                                returns only the sample data set. In a 
                                production inBloom deployment, 
                                <i>bulk/extract/tenant</i> resource returns 
                                real data for the tenant.

                The following are the open defects currently used to track 
                known issues in this release:

                <h3 class="title"><a name="DE2826"></a>DE2826: Security issue when making education organization changes.</h3>
                <p>
                    There is a known security issue in how inBloom currently 
                    handles adding, updating, and deleting education 
                    organization entity instances. A future inBloom release 
                    will resolve this issue. Until the inBloom deployment you 
                    are working with is updated to that release, you must 
                    perform the workaround described below under the following 
                    conditions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When you run a forced delete action on an 
                            education organization through bulk ingestion
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When you add a new education organization, 
                            either through bulk ingestion or the API 
                            (not including the first bulk ingestion job 
                            for the tenant)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When you update an education organization, 
                            either through bulk ingestion or the API, 
                            in a way that changes its place in the 
                            organizational hierarchy
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Workaround:</strong> Follow that change with a 
                    separate ingestion job that includes all the 
                    <em>studentSchoolAssociation</em> entity instances that 
                    fall under that education organization in the hierarchy. 
                    In the control file for that ingestion job, use 
                    <em>@duplicate-detection</em> to override the default 
                    behavior of skipping duplicates: use 
                    <em>@duplicate-detection=reset</em> if there is any new 
                    data in the same job, or use 
                    <em>@duplicate-detection=disable</em> if the data 
                    contains only the duplicates. See the ingestion guide 
                    for details on preparing ingestion jobs and their 
                    associated control files. 
                </p>

                <h3 class="title"><a name="DE2864"></a>DE2864: FIXME</h3>
                <p>
                    Any data that includes an ampersand (&amp;), 
                    greater-than (&gt;), or less-than (&lt;) character may 
                    have been improperly transformed during XML encoding when 
                    ingested by inBloom. This issue has been resolved. When 
                    updating to this release, if a tenant has any records 
                    containing these characters, inBloom recommends that 
                    tenant purge and re-ingest its data.
