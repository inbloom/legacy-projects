<!-------------- WHAT'S NEW --> 
<div class="section">
    
    <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sect-release_notes-whats_new"></a>What's New?</h2>
    
    <p>
        The following new features were added in 1.3.75:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <!-- from Galactus -->
            <p>
                <strong>Bulk Extract for Tenants</strong> -
                Bulk data extraction through the REST API, added in 1.2.74,
                includes the following new features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Using the new bulk/extract/tenant resource, a 
                        REST API client can now access data for the tenant
                        associated with the current authenticated user. 
                        For this to work, the current user must have an 
                        inBloom user role that includes the bulk extract 
                        right. REST API documentation covers the new
                        <i>bulk/extract/tenant</i> resource along with 
                        important security and header information 
                        you need to know when using it.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The bulk extract resources now support byte range 
                        requests, which allow REST API clients to resume
                        interrupted downloads. To take advantage of this
                        feature, the client must pass specific HTTP header
                        fields to the call as described in REST API
                        documentation for <i>bulk/extract/tenant</i>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The bulk extract resources now support adding a version 
                        number in the URI. While having a version in the URI 
                        is supported, the behavior of the URI is to always 
                        use the latest API version. Operator documentation
                        includes information on how to refresh bulk extract
                        files when deploying a new version of the REST API.
                    </p>

            <!-- from Galactus -->
            <p>
                <strong>Bulk Extract is Different in the Sandbox</strong>
                Starting with this release, the bulk extract behavior differs 
                between sandbox and production environments. In the inBloom 
                Sandbox, making bulk extract API calls returns only the sample 
                data set. In a production inBloom deployment, 
                <i>bulk/extract/tenant</i> resource returns real data for 
                the tenant.

                <strong>Deletes Through Ingestion</strong> - The deletes 
                through ingestion functionality, added in 1.2.74, now 
                supports forced deletes in addition to safe deletes. 
                Ingestion documentation provides instructions on how these 
                features work and how to use them.

                Schema The inBloom-Ed-Fi XML Schema used in data ingestion 
                has been updated to support deletes through ingestion. This 
                includes the following updates to the interchange XSDs 
                published by inBloom. See the "Ingestion Schema Updates" 
                section for more details:

                        Added Force and LogViolations attributes to the 
                        SLC-ActionType definition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Added reference types for all entities that did not 
                        previously have a reference type, which provides for 
                        the deletion of all entities by reference in addition 
                        to full entity body.

                        Force (Optional): This new Boolean attribute can be 
                        used to force deletion of data even if it leaves

                        can be used when Force="True" to instruct the 
                        ingestion system to log information about orphaned 
                        objects in the system resulting from the forced 
                        delete.
