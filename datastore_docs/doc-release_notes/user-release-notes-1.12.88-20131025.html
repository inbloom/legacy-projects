        <h2 id="whatsNew">What's New?</h2>

        <h3>Developer Enablement of Applications for Any Education Organization in the SEA Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>
            With this release, developers now have the ability to enable an application for any education organization in any state education organization hierarchy via a tree control that has been added to the Edit Application page.
        </p>

        <h3>Hosted Admin Authorization of Applications for Any Education Organization in the Admin's Education Organization Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>
            With this release, Hosted Admins (both SEA and LEA) now have the ability to authorize an application for any education organization in their education organization hierarchy via a tree control on the Application Authorization Dashboard page.  Ability for Hosted LEA Admins to authorize applications was restored as part of this change.
        </p>

        <h3>New GradeLevelType Enumeration</h3>
        <p>

            The following is a list of previously reported issues which have been resolved this release.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="knownIssues">Known Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The following are the open defects currently used to track known issues in this release.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-778" target="_BLANK">DS-778</a>: EducationOrganization references to Program are not properly ingested.</h3>
        <p>
            The programReference is not yet implemented for educationOrganization entities. As a result, the API does not provide a link between educationOrganization and program entities.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-779" target="_BLANK">DS-779</a>: A DisciplineDescriptor is not currently supported in Interchange-StudentDiscipline.</h3>
        <p>
            This descriptor is not currently supported. However, a reference to this descriptor is required for the DisciplineAction entity.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-782" target="_BLANK">DS-782</a>: Global uniqueness of ProgramIdentifier is assumed when multiple educationOrganizations can use the same IDs.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion process assumes that the Program ID is unique within a tenant, but this should be unique within the specified educationOrganization instead. As a result, the reference could resolve incorrectly.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-783" target="_BLANK">DS-783</a>: Aggregate Viewers cannot see themselves.</h3>
        <p>
            Users with the Aggregate Viewer role cannot see their own Teacher or Staff entity.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-784" target="_BLANK">DS-784</a>: Section, school and session references in AttendanceEvent are ignored.</h3>
        <p>
            The way AttendanceEvent entities are handled ignores explicit characterization of the attendance event - by school, section, session. As a result, AttendanceEvents for students attending multiple schools do not properly persist.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-786" target="_BLANK">DS-786</a>: Internet Explorer 8 users may experience issues when using the dashboard builder.</h3>
        <p>
            If you are using Internet Explorer 8 and the dashboard builder, then intermittently the release after a drag and drop does not return the page to the correct state.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-784" target="_BLANK">DS-787</a>: Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error.</h3>
        <p>
            Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error. This error can cause the sectionInfo panel to not display.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-788" target="_BLANK">DS-788</a>: The ingestion service is able to handle more than one teacher of record.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion service can accept more than one teacher for a single section. The dashboard does not currently support this behavior.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-790" target="_BLANK">DS-790</a>: Attendance Rate should be removed.</h3>
        <p>
            The current attendance record includes an attendance rate column that may not be accurate for some use cases. The column could be removed by default in a future release.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-791" target="_BLANK">DS-791</a>: Dashboard may not display all data.</h3>
        <p>
            When a large dataset is available, the initial dashboard view may only display a subset of the data. The dashboard currently does not display a message explaining this scenario.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-780" target="_BLANK">DS-780</a>: An error occurs if an OAuth Callback URL does not begin with "HTTPS".</h3>
        <p>
            If an application includes a callback URL that does not begin with "https://", then an error message is returned.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-781" target="_BLANK">DS-781</a>: HATEOS links don't always work as expected.</h3>
        <p>
            The HATEOS links that the API returns may not work as expected in all cases. The contextual URI rewrites convert some API requests. Some of these converted requests may not return what is expected.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-785" target="_BLANK">DS-785</a>: Selecting a filter after listing a section removes all student data.</h3>
        <p>
            When viewing a list of students using the inBloom Dashboard, choosing a filter related to that student's "special needs" status results in a "no students found" error.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-792" target="_BLANK">DS-792</a>: There is a 250 result limit on global entities contained in elasticsearch.</h3>
        <p>
            When querying the following entities, results are limited to a maximum of 250 returns:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>/assessments</p></li>
            <li><p>/competencyLevelDescriptor</p></li>
            <li><p>/learningObjectives</p></li>
            <li><p>/learningStandards</p></li>
            <li><p>/studentCompetencyObjectives</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-793" target="_BLANK">DS-793</a>: Deletes from Interchanges aside from InterchangeAssessmentMetadata does not work for ObjectiveAssessement and possibly others.</h3>
        <p>
            The Action Entity type can be present in any interchange and should support deletion of any entity type. Currently, the Action Entity with the type attribute set to DELETE will only support deletion of entities within the interchange in which the Action Entity is present. 
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-794" target="_BLANK">DS-794</a>: Newly created student entity is unsearchable.</h3>
        <p>
            After creating a student entity, it cannot be retrieved from the API endpoint.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-795" target="_BLANK">DS-795</a>: Updating a learningObjective entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-796" target="_BLANK">DS-796</a>: Updating a learningStandard entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-797" target="_BLANK">DS-797</a>: Updating a courseOffering entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://support.inbloom.org/browse/DS-798" target="_BLANK">DS-798</a>: Delta bulk extract behavior is incorrect for force delete of Assessment followed by an ObjectiveAssessment update in the same delta interval.</h3>
        <p>
            There is a condition where "AssessmentItem", "ObjectiveAssessment", "StudentAssessmentItem", or "StudentObjectiveAssessment" instances refer to a parent entity instance that does not exist in the data store (because of forced deletion of that entity or out of order ingestion). If these dependent entities are updated, then a "hollow" parent entity which includes the dependent entity instance data is included in the bulk extract. The correct behavior is that there is no entry in the bulk extract when the referred to entity instance does not exist.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="webBrowserCompatibility">Web Browser Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
            inBloom technology Dashboard is best viewed in Internet Explorer 8+, Firefox 6+, Safari 4+ with 1024x768 as the minimum recommended screen resolution.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h2>
        <p> 
            Known limitations in this release are summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Landing Zone File Size Limit</strong> - 
                    Currently the Sandbox landing zones enforce a size limit of 5 MB for ingestion archive files, corresponding to approximately 150-25MB of uncompressed XML data, or about 150,000-250,000 records. In this release, ingesting a data set of this size should take less than 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Unsupported Ed-Fi Entities</strong> - 
                    Some Ed-Fi entities are not yet supported and, thus, not consumable through data ingestion. For additional information, see the <a href="https://inbloom.org/library">inBloom Ingestion Guide</a>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Educator Dashboard</strong> - 
                    Not all ingestible data is displayed in inBloom educator dashboards, including discipline incidents, cohorts or student competencies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Aggregate Viewer Roles</strong> - 
                    Aggregate Viewer roles do not yet provide aggregate view of data.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>API Custom Data Size Limit</strong> - 
                    Maximum currently enforced size of a custom data resource in API is 128KB. The theoretical maximum object size supported by the software platform is 16MB, but a more practical restriction of 128KB has been placed on it in order to encourage efficient data management practices and application responsiveness. Custom data fields are not intended to be used to store multimedia content or other types of human-readable documents, for example. Such resources are better served through existing web-based infrastructure.
                </p>
