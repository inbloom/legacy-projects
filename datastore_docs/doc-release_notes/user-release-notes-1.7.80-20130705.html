        <h3>Caution</h3>
        <p>
            The inBloom sandbox environment MUST NOT contain real data,
            including educational records or personally identifiable 
            information (PII) for students or educators. Make sure to 
            use only artificial or fabricated data. inBloom provides 
            fabricated sample data sets, available for download or
            as a selection when setting up your sandbox online.

        <h2 id="whatsNew">What's New?</h2>
        
        <h3>Bulk Extract - Delta SEA</h3>
        <p>
            The following entities are now supported by the delta SEA bulk 
            extract:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>assessment</li>
            <li>assessmentFamily*</li>
            <li>assessmentItem*</li>
            <li>assessmentPeriodDescriptor*</li>
            <li>objectiveAssessment*</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*included in Bulk Extract as part of Assessment</p>
        
        <h3>Student Login</h3>
        <p>
            Students are now able to access all of the data that is relevant 
            to them. For more information about the default Student role and 
            rights, as well as the business rules that govern access of 
            student data, please see the
            <a href="https://inbloom.org/library">inBloom product documentation</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>New role names in default roles</strong>: The default 
            role groups have been updated to include new default role names. 
            Now users can have different role names to be able to associate 
            with a role group. For example users can have a role name 
            Principal to get the rights that are associated with the 
            Leader role group. The default rights for each group have not 
            been modified.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sandbox users will notice these new roles when they impersonate 
            a user from the inBloom provided sample data.
        </p>

        <h3>The students/{id} API resource has been updated to support contextual roles.</h3>
        <p>
            In order for the <em>students/{id}</em> API resource to work
            following role changes in this release, teachers now require
            a certain <em>staffEducationOrganizationAssociation</em> value.
            This value must associate the teacher with an education 
            organization that is high enough in the edOrg hierarchy to have 
            authority over both the teacher and the student whose data that teacher 
            wishes to access. The teacher must also have a role with that 
            edOrg that is mapped to the necessary rights to access the
            particular student through a program, cohort, or section that they
            both belong. The teacher must have these rights on login in order
            to access the target student data.

        <h2 id="ingestionSchemaUpdates">Ingestion Schema Updates</h2>
        <p>
            No changes were made to the ingestion schema in this release.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="dataModelUpdates">Data Model Updates</h2>
        <p>
            No changes were made to the logical data model in this release.

        <h2 id="apiUpdates">API Updates</h2>
        <p>
            This release includes the following changes to the API:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The <em>/student/{id}</em> resource now retrieves data 
                    based on the user's permission by educationOrganization. 
                    See Section 11.3 of the Administrator Documentation for 
                    more detail.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The following API resources were deprecated in this release:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>bulk/extract/tenant</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Added</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        
        <h3>Deprecated</h3>
        <p>
            No resources were deprecated in the API for this release.
        </p>
        
        <h3>New and Updated Fields</h3>
        <p>
            No fields were added or updated in API resources for this release.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="actionsRequiredOnUpdate">Actions Required on Update</h2>
        <p>
            No action is required by users on update.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="resolvedIssues">Resolved Issues</h2>
        
        <p>
            The following is a list of previously reported issues which have
            been resolved this release.
        </p>
        
        <h3>DE2901: Custom Role page UI breaks on long custom role name.</h3>
        <p>
            Long custom role names no longer overlap cell boundaries in 
            the UI in the role mapping tool.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2848: ControlFileProccessor does not scale to handle large numbers of files in a .zip file.</h3>
        <p>
            Performance improvements in the ingestion system have eliminated 
            the need to use MD5 checksum values in the control file. 
            If these values are included as before, they are now ignored 
            during ingestion. Ingestion documentation now reflects the 
            updated control file format.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="knownIssues">Known Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The following are the open defects currently used to track known 
            issues in this release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE198: EducationOrganization references to Program are not properly ingested.</h3>
        <p>
            The programReference is not yet implemented for 
            educationOrganization entities. As a result, the API does not 
            provide a link between educationOrganization and program entities.
        </p>
        <h3>DE273: A DisciplineDescriptor is not currently supported in Interchange-StudentDiscipline.</h3>
        <p>
            This descriptor is not currently supported. However, a 
            reference to this descriptor is required for the DisciplineAction
            entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE325: Global uniqueness of ProgramIdentifier is assumed when multiple EdOrgs can use the same IDs.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion process assumes that the Program ID is unique 
            within a tenant, but this should be unique within the specified 
            EdOrg instead. As a result, the reference could resolve incorrectly.
        </p>
        <h3>DE408: Aggregate Viewers cannot see themselves.</h3>
        <p>
            Users with the Aggregate Viewer role cannot see their own 
            Teacher or Staff entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE710: Section, school and session references in AttendanceEvent are ignored.</h3>
        <p>
            The way AttendanceEvent entities are handled ignores explicit 
            characterization of the attendance event - by school, section, 
            session. As a result, AttendanceEvents for students attending 
            multiple schools do not properly persist.
        </p>
        <h3>DE921: Duplicates are not reported.</h3>
        <p>
            Error reports are not always clear regarding the records 
            persisted. When there are duplicates within the XML file, or a 
            record already exists, the ingestion engine still updates the 
            record. However, this record count is not included in the 
            ingested records count.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1434: Internet Explorer 8 users may experience issues when using the dashboard builder.</h3>
        <p>
            If you are using Internet Explorer 8 and the dashboard builder, 
            then intermittently the release after a drag and drop does not 
            return the page to the correct state.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1457: Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error.</h3>
        <p>
            Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" 
            returns a 403 error. This error can cause the sectionInfo panel 
            to not display.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1458: The ingestion service is able to handle more than one teacher of record.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion service can accept more than one teacher for 
            a single section. The dashboard does not currently support 
            this behavior.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1573: Attendance Rate should be removed.</h3>
        <p>
            The current attendance record includes an attendance rate 
            column that may not be accurate for some use cases. The 
            column could be removed by default in a future release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1647: Dashboard may not display all data.</h3>
        <p>
            When a large dataset is available, the initial dashboard view 
            may only display a subset of the data. The dashboard currently 
            does not display a message explaining this scenario.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1728: An error occurs if an OAuth Callback URL does not begin with "HTTPS".</h3>
        <p>
            If an application includes a callback URL that does not begin 
            with "https://", then an error message is returned.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2079: HATEOS links don't always work as expected.</h3>
        <p>
            The HATEOS links that the API returns may not work as expected 
            in all cases. The contextual URI rewrites convert some API 
            requests. Some of these converted requests may not return 
            what is expected.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2160: Selecting a filter after listing a section removes all student data.</h3>
        <p>
            When viewing a list of students using the inBloom Dashboard, 
            choosing a filter related to that student's "special needs" 
            status results in a "no students found" error.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2300: There is a 250 result limit on global entities contained in elasticsearch.</h3>
        <p>
            When querying the following entities, results are limited to a 
            maximum of 250 returns:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>/assessments</p></li>
            <li><p>/competencyLevelDescriptor</p></li>
            <li><p>/learningObjectives</p></li>
            <li><p>/learningStandards</p></li>
            <li><p>/studentCompetencyObjectives</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DE2725: Updating an entity does not correctly update the search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity 
            is not updated in elasticsearch and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2833: Deletes from Interchanges aside from InterchangeAssessmentMetadata does not work for ObjectiveAssessement and possibly others.</h3>
        <p>
            The Action Entity type can be present in any interchange 
            and should support deletion of any entity type. Currently, 
            the Action Entity with the type attribute set to DELETE will 
            only support deletion of entities within the interchange in 
            which the Action Entity is present. 
        </p>
        <h3>DE2851: Newly created student entity is unsearchable.</h3>
        <p>
            After creating a student entity, it cannot be retrieved from the 
            API endpoint.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2852: Updating a learningObjective entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2853: Updating a learningStandard entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2857: Updating a courseOffering entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2914: Delta bulk extract behavior is incorrect for force delete of Assessment followed by an ObjectiveAssessment update in the same delta interval.</h3>
        <p>
            There is a condition where "AssessmentItem", "ObjectiveAssessment", "StudentAssessmentItem", or "StudentObjectiveAssessment" instances 
            refer to a parent entity instance that does not exist in the data store (because of forced deletion of that entity or out of order ingestion). 
            If these dependent entities are updated, then a "hollow" parent entity which includes the dependent entity instance 
            data is included in the bulk extract.  
            The correct behavior is that there is no entry in the bulk extract when the referred to entity instance does not exist.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="webBrowserCompatibility">Web Browser Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
            inBloom technology Dashboard is best viewed in 
            Internet Explorer 8+, Firefox 6+, Safari 4+ 
            with 1024x768 as the minimum recommended screen 
            resolution.

        <h2 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h2>
        <p> 
            Known limitations in this release are summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Landing Zone File Size Limit</strong> - 
                    Currently the Sandbox landing zones enforce a size 
                    limit of 5 MB for ingestion archive files, 
                    corresponding to approximately 150-25MB of 
                    uncompressed XML data, or about 150,000-250,000 
                    records. In this release, ingesting a data set of 
                    this size should take less than 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Unsupported Ed-Fi Entities</strong> - 
                    Some Ed-Fi entities are not yet supported and, thus, 
                    not consumable through data ingestion. For additional 
                    information, see the 
                    <a href="https://inbloom.org/library">inBloom Ingestion Guide</a>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Educator Dashboard</strong> - 
                    Not all ingestible data is displayed in inBloom 
                    educator dashboards, including discipline incidents, 
                    cohorts or student competencies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Aggregate Viewer Roles</strong> - 
                    Aggregate Viewer roles do not yet provide aggregate 
                    view of data.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>API Custom Data Size Limit</strong> - 
                    Maximum currently enforced size of a custom data 
                    resource in API is 128KB. The theoretical maximum 
                    object size supported by the software platform is 
                    16MB, but a more practical restriction of 128KB has 
                    been placed on it in order to encourage efficient 
                    data management practices and application responsiveness. 
                    Custom data fields are not intended to be used to 
                    store multimedia content or other types of
