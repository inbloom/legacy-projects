        Alpha.0 is the initial release of the SLC technology 
        services, education dashboards, and documentation.
    </p><p>
        With this release, SLC provides application developers with
        access to a sandbox SLC environment and a series of 
        dedicated developer camps taking place over the next several months 
        [[[FIXME: link "developer camps" to the corresponding URL for info]]]. 
        While accessing their sandbox, developers can ingest SLC 
        sample data sets, sign in as different users with varying roles, and
        create new applications that interact with the data using the 
        SLC REST API. These applications can perform the same tasks
        available to state and district tenants.
    </p><p>
        REMINDER: The Sandbox MUST NOT contain actual student data. Users
        should load only artificial or fabricated data into the sandbox. 
        The SLC provides sample fabricated data sets available 
        for download from the Sandbox Developer Web Site at 
        <a class="link" href="http://dev.slcedu.org/getting-started/sandbox/" target="_self">http://dev.slcedu.org/getting-started/sandbox/</a>.

The time taken to tag new data is dependent upon how large the dataset is, how much of the data is new, and the state of the tagger when the new data is created.

                        When sandbox users ingest data sets through the landing zone,
                        they may experience longer-than-expected load times.
                        To address this, we have set a size limit of 1 MB for 
                        ingestion archive files, corresponding to approximately 30-50MB 
                        of uncompressed XML data, or about 30,000-50,000 records. 
                        In Alpha.0, ingesting a data set of this size should take 
                        about 15 minutes. This load time issue first appeared during
                        the initial transition to the Alpha.0 operational environment,
                        and is currently under diagnosis. Please check the

There is no limitation to the number of landing zones they can provision using a custom educational organization.Workaround:If the user wants to re-ingest a sample dataset and can not re-provision the landing zone, the best way is to create a custom landing zone and update the sample data to have the matching high level ed-org.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="US2660"></a>US2660: App Permissions - Assigning Existing Data Category Rights</h3></div></div></div><p>An application that is authorized by a LEA, can access the LEA's data based on the user's permissions (on which behalf the application is accessing LEA's data) and the application features/capabilities. There is no additional restriction that LEA can impose other than 'blanket' access (application can or cannot access LEA's data on user's behalf). Additional functionality will be built to allow the LEA to choose what rights over the existing data categoriesto give to certain application. The intersection of the user's and application's permissions and the application's capabilitieswill define in which way the user will be able to access the LEA's data. For example, if an application allows editing of general student data, and a user with IT Administrator role (which gives permission for editing student data) is using the application, he/she will not be able to edit any student data if this right has not been given to the application by the LEA.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="US1727"></a>US1727: Stable URLs for Student Profile Pages</h3></div></div></div><p>In Dashboard, student profile and list URLs are unique and can be bookmarked, but will change at a later time, and with the ingestion of new data, so they are not permanently canonical at this time.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="US2724"></a>US2724: Remove "Attendance and Discipline" Tab Until Data is Available</h3></div></div></div><p>In some cases depending on configuration, a blank "Attendance and Discipline" tab may appear in Student Profiles.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="US2786"></a>US2786: Admin: Provision Landing Zone shouldn't require EdOrg Entry</h3></div></div></div><p>When provisioning a landing zone, the user must provision the landing zone at the edOrg they are a part of.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="US2714"></a>US2714: Add Pagination to List of Students</h3></div></div></div><p>Dashboard displays a maximum of 50 students in a selected section, and does not support pagination at this time.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="US1030"></a>US1030: Current Courses and Grades Panel</h3></div></div></div><p>Student Profiles do not yet have a tab displaying a student's current courses and associated grades, even when this data is ingested into SLI.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="US2121"></a>US2121: Password Reset for SLI Hosted Users</h3></div></div></div><p>If an SLI hosted directory user has forgotten own password, he/she will have to ask the SLC Operator (in an offline process) to reset the password for him/her.
