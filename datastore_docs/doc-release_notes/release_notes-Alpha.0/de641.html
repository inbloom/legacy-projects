<p>
    The SLC Java Client Library does not support multiple sessions. When 
    used in a multi-session environment, users can have conflicting
    actions, such as updating the same resource at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Workaround: Create an instance of the SLC Java Client Library for 
    each connection to the REST API, then attach the <i>SLIClient</i> 
    to the <i>HttpSession</i>. Sample code for this is available in the 
    <i>AuthFiter.java class</i> for the <i>Sample</i> application.
