        &RELEASE; is the initial release of the &COMPANYABBR; technology 
        services, education dashboards, and documentation.

        With this release, &COMPANYABBR; provides application developers with
        access to a sandbox &COMPANYABBR; environment and a series of 
        dedicated developer camps taking place over the next several months 
        [[[FIXME: link "developer camps" to the corresponding URL for info]]]. 
        While accessing their sandbox, developers can ingest &COMPANYABBR; 
        sample data sets, sign in as different users with varying roles, and
        create new applications that interact with the data using the 
        &COMPANYABBR; REST API. These applications can perform the same tasks
        available to state and district tenants.
    </para>
    <para>
        REMINDER: The Sandbox MUST NOT contain actual student data. Users
        should load only artificial or fabricated data into the sandbox. 
        The &COMPANYABBR; provides sample fabricated data sets available 
        for download from the Sandbox Developer Web Site at
