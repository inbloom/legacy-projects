    This error occurs when the authenticated user doesn't have 
    any contextual data or does not have rights to access 
    the application.
</p>
<p>
    Workaround: Identify a user in the ingested data set that 
    has contextual data, or data to which that user has permission
    within the context of signing in to that application. 
    Examples include teachers with sections and students assigned
    to them. In addition, the <i>SLC Operator</i> administrator 
    role must enable the application for that user's education
    organization.
