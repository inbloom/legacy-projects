<p>
    When using the Data Browser, if a user signs out of one 
    account and, before closing the Web browser, signs in 
    using a different account <i>after</i> the prior user 
    account's session has expired, the top right corner of the 
    Data Browser will still show the prior user's name.
</p>
<p>
    Workaround: Close and relaunch the Web browser to see
    the correct name displayed.
