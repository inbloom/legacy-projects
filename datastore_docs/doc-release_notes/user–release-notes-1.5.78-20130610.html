        <h2>What's New?</h2>
        
        <h3>Bulk Extract - Purge Events</h3>
        
        <p>
            Bulk Extract's Delta Deletes file reports purge events performed 
            through the ingestion system. Purge events are reported differently
            than deletes events. For details, see documentation for the bulk 
            extract API.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Bulk Extract - Error Reporting</h3>
        
        <p>
            Basic error reporting metrics are captured during the creation of 
            the bulk extract data files. In the same directory as the data 
            files, error.txt is created to report errors that occurred during 
            bulk extraction. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The error.txt file indicates that errors occurred during the 
            process and the latest successful full extract should be 
            obtained. A list is included to provide more specific information 
            about the type of errors that were encountered. The file lists 
            the number of errors that occurred per entity type.
        </p>
        <p>Example: 2 errors occurred for entity type student</p>

                    <li>
                        Changes enumeration to a string with minimum length 
                        of 1 and maximum length of 75
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adds an optional attribute, IdentificationSystem, 
                        that is a string with a minimum length of 1 and a 
                        maximum length of 60
                    </li>

        <h2>Resolved Issues</h2>
        
        <p>
            The following is a list of previously reported issues which have
            been resolved this release.
        </p>
        
        <h3>DE2826: Forced Deletion, Update or Insert of Ed Orgs may cause inappropriate access through the API</h3>
        <p>
            Forced Deletion, Update or Insert of Ed Orgs may cause 
            inappropriate access through the API.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2835: When checking for expired status, today is considered expired</h3>
        <p>
            When determining access to data through an association (e.g. 
            StaffEducationOrgAssignmentAssociation), in cases when the 
            association's end date is 'today', the association is considered 
            expired and the user loses access. It should be considered as 
            current.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2867: Bulk Extract: Full Extract missing staffEdOrg references when staff in multiple LEAs</h3>
        <p>
            When Staff is in multiple EducationOrganizations (has multiple 
            StaffEducationOrgAssignmentAssociations), the full (top-level) 
            LEA extract includes just one 
            StaffEducationOrgAssignmentAssociation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The following are the open defects currently used to track known 
            issues in this release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE198: EducationOrganization references to Program are not properly ingested.</h3>
        <p>
            This reference is not implemented yet. As a result, the API does 
            not provide a link from the EdOrg to the Program.
        </p>
        <h3>DE273: A DisciplineDescriptor is not currently supported in Interchange-StudentDiscipline.</h3>
        <p>
            This descriptor is not currently supported. However, a reference 
            to this descriptor is required for the DisciplineAction entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE325: Global uniqueness of ProgramIdentifier is assumed when multiple EdOrgs can use the same IDs.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion process assumes that the Program ID is unique 
            within a tenant, but this should be unique within the specified 
            EdOrg instead. As a result, the reference could resolve 
            incorrectly.
        </p>
        <h3>DE408: Aggregate Viewers cannot see themselves.</h3>
        <p>
            Users with the Aggregate Viewer role cannot see their own Teacher 
            or Staff entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE710: Section, school and session references in AttendanceEvent are ignored.</h3>
        <p>
            The way AttendanceEvent entities are handled ignores explicit 
            characterization of the attendance event - by school, section, 
            session. As a result, AttendanceEvents for students attending 
            multiple schools do not properly persist.
        </p>
        <h3>DE840: inBloom data model does not account for Ed-Fi Core v. 1.0.03 version of Address with Country and AddressLine</h3>
        <p>
            The Address entity changed in EdFi 1.0.03 to have separate 
            structures to represent addresses that specify "Country" with 
            generic "AddressLine"s. Ingestion does not currently account for 
            this change and drops country code and the international address 
            lines.
        </p>
        <h3>DE921: Duplicates are not reported.</h3>
        <p>
            Error reports are not always clear regarding the records persisted.
            When there are duplicates within the XML file, or a record already 
            exists, the ingestion engine still updates the record. However, 
            this record count is not included in the ingested records count.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1434: Internet Explorer 8 users may experience issues when using the dashboard builder.</h3>
        <p>
            If you are using Internet Explorer 8 and the dashboard builder, 
            then intermittently the release after a drag and drop does not 
            return the page to the correct state.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1457: Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error.</h3>
        <p>
            Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" 
            returns a 403 error. This error can cause the sectionInfo panel 
            to not display.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1458: The ingestion service is able to handle more than one teacher of record.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion service can accept more than one teacher for a 
            single section. The dashboard does not currently support this 
            behavior.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1573: Attendance Rate should be removed.</h3>
        <p>
            The current attendance record includes an attendance rate column 
            that may not be accurate for some use cases. The column could be 
            removed by default in a future release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1647: Dashboard may not display all data.</h3>
        <p>
            When a large dataset is available, the initial dashboard view may 
            only display a subset of the data. The dashboard currently does 
            not display a message explaining this scenario.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1728: An error occurs if an OAuth Callback URL does not begin with "HTTPS".</h3>
        <p>
            If an application includes a callback URL that does not begin 
            with "https://", then an error message is returned.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2079: HATEOS links don't always work as expected.</h3>
        <p>
            The HATEOS links that the API returns may not work as expected 
            in all cases. The contextual URI rewrites convert some API 
            requests. Some of these converted requests may not return what 
            is expected.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2160: Selecting a filter after listing a section removes all student data.</h3>
        <p>
            When viewing a list of students using the inBloom Dashboard, 
            choosing a filter related to that student's "special needs" 
            status results in a "no students found" error.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2300: There is a 250 result limit on global entities contained in elasticsearch.</h3>
        <p>
            When querying the following entities, results are limited to a 
            maximum of 250 returns:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>/assessments</li>
            <li>/competencyLevelDescriptor</li>
            <li>/learningObjectives</li>
            <li>/learningStandards</li>
            <li>/studentCompetencyObjectives</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DE2725: Updating an entity does not correctly update the search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity 
            is not updated in elasticsearch and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2833: Deletes from Interchanges aside from InterchangeAssessmentMetadata does not work for ObjectiveAssessement and possibly others.</h3>
        <p>
            The Action entity type can be present in any interchange and 
            should support deletion of any entity type. Currently, the Action 
            entity with the type attribute set to DELETE will only support 
            deletion of entities within the interchange in which the Action 
            entity is present.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>DE2851: Newly created student entity is unsearchable.</h3>
        <p>
            After creating a student entity, it cannot be retrieved the from 
            API endpoint.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2852: Updating a learningObjective entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2853: Updating a learningStandard entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2857: Updating a courseOffering entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
