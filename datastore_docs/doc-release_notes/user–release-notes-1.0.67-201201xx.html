  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="sect-release_notes-whats_new"></a>What's New?</h2> 
  <p>The following new features were added in 1.0.67:</p> 
    <ul>
    <!-- <li><strong>Student search API</strong> - Our new student search API is available as of this release. It allows developers to build applications that allow users to query for specific students and is more flexible than the legacy search and filter functionality.
        
        Five additional entities are now available to query via the Search capability.
        <ul>
          <li>/assessments</li>
          <li>/competencyLevelDescriptor</li>
          <li>/learningObjectives</li>
          <li>/learningStandards</li>
          <li>/studentCompetencyObjectives</li>
        </ul> </li> -->  
        <li><strong>SEA/LEA end users only able to write data within own EdOrg hierarchy</strong> - The SLI, through the API, allows access of student's data across EdOrgs in cases when a student is enrolled in more than a one EdOrg. Because the roles are not aware of the context, scenarios existed where data that does not belong to the user's EdOrg (hierarchy) can be edited. This feature disables any writing to data that is not in the user's EdOrg hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Ingestion Schema Changes</h2>
  <p>We have modified the ingestion schema, in many cases using extensions and restrictions. The following section describes those changes.</p>
  <!--<p>Of note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If there is an extension, use that extension in place of the original Ed-Fi entity.</li>
    <li>If there is a restriction, use the restriction in place of the original Ed-Fi Entity.</li>
    <li>Several entities have been marked <strong>Temporary</strong>. This indicates that the entity will have future additions and is not currently in its SLC-Entity form.</li>
  </ul>-->
  <h2>Domain Entities</h2>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">
    <li><strong>EducationalOrgReference</strong> - Removed the REF attribute, as ID/REF are no longer supported.</li>    
    </ul>    
 <!-- 
  <h2>Associations</h2>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Extended Reference Types</h2>

 <!--   <h2>Non-queryable Resources</h2><!-- Change this
    <p>Some resources previously allowed for arbitrary queries, such as /assessments?assessmentName="SAT" or /assessments?assessmentName=~"^S[\w]+T". This capability has been blocked for the following resources:</p>
    <ul></ul> -->
    
 <!--   <h2>Cardinality Changes</h2>
    <p>The number of maximum or minimum occurences for several elements have changed. In some cases, this will make a formerly optional element now required. The following elements have changed:</p>

The ingestion job will complete, but it will not produce a job log file or a error file. This issue was resolved by this fix.</p></div>
       <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DE1876"></a>DE1876: Posting an entity twice results in API 500 error</h3></div></div></div><p>Posting an entity twice resulted in an API 500 error. We had changed features of the natural keys calculations that caused this error. We have fixed this defect.</p></div>
       <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DE2339"></a>DE2339: Incorrect error resource ID stored</h3></div></div></div><p>Incorrect resourceID of "studentAssessmentItem" in error messages. This should have been the corresponding AssessmentMetaData XML file from which it originated.  As a result, no error files were created, and the job was erroneously reported as having all records processed successfully. With this fix this issue had been corrected.</p></div>

As a result, the reference could resolve incorrectly.</p></div>
