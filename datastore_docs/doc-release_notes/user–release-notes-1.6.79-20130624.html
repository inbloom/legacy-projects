        <h3>Caution</h3>
        <p>
            The inBloom sandbox environment MUST NOT contain real data,
            including educational records or personally identifiable 
            information (PII) for students or educators. Make sure to 
            use only artificial or fabricated data. inBloom provides 
            fabricated sample data sets, available for download or

            entities, the student's own entity, and the student's parent 
            and studentParentAssocations entities. Future versions of 
            inBloom will enable students to access all data that is relevant
            to them. For more information about the default Student role 
            and rights, including the business rules that govern access 
            of student data, please see the 
            <a href="https://inbloom.org/sites/default/files/docs-developer/doc-3e1677bd-a02f-44a0-9c73-4eaaa1e1b064.html">inBloom Roles and Permissions</a>

        <h2 id="dataModelUpdates">Data Model Updates</h2>
        <p>
            This release includes the following updates to the data model:
        </p>
        <h3>Contextual roles support</h3>
        <p>
            The Data Model has been modified to allow unrestricted API user 
            role names.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    staffEducationOrganizationAssociation
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The attribute staffClassification has been 
                            modified from an enumerated string to an 
                            unrestricted string. The staffClassification 
                            field is synonymous with a role name assigned 
                            to a staff member for a particular education 
                            organization. That role is used to authenticate 
                            an API user by matching the role against the 
                            user roles provided by the federated IDP. 
                            For more about user authentication, see the 
                            inBloom administrator documentation.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="ingestionSchemaUpdates">Ingestion Schema Updates</h2>
        <p>
            This release includes the following updates to the ingestion 
            schema, listed by entity type:
        </p>
        <h3>Contextual roles support</h3>
        <p>
            The Ingestion schema has been modified to allow unrestricted 
            API user role names:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>SLC-StaffClassificationType</strong> - 
                    replaces StaffClassificationType in Ed-Fi Core as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Changes enumeration to an unrestricted string
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Applies these changes to the following entities: 
                            For StaffEducationOrgAssignmentAssociation: 
                            StaffClassification
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The roles provided by the federated IDP should match at least 
            one of these ingested roles.
        </p>
        <h3>Enumeration value additions</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion schema has been modified to support additional 
            enumeration values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    "Other" was added as an enumeration value for the 
                    following types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AdministrationEnvironmentType</li>
                    <li>BehaviorCategoryType</li>
                    <li>EducationalEnvironmentType</li>
                    <li>GradeType</li>
                    <li>ItemCategoryType</li>
                    <li>IncidentLocationType</li>
                    <li>LinguisticAccommodationItemType</li>
                    <li>SchoolCategoryItemType</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    "Did not meet standard" was added as an enumeration 
                    value for AssessmentItemResultType.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The following were added as enumerated values for TermType: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Term 0</li>
                    <li>Term 1</li>
                    <li>Term 2</li>
                    <li>Term 3</li>

                    <li>Term 5</li>
                    <li>Term 6</li>
                    <li>Term 7</li>
                    <li>Term 8</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="apiUpdates">API Updates</h2>
        
        <p>
            This release includes the following changes to the API:

        <h2 id="actionsRequiredOnUpdate">Actions Required on Update</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Production Users</strong>: An update is required to 
            ensure that federated users can authenticate following the 
            updates to inBloom authentication. Two options are available 
            to make this update:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    (Recommended) Administrator updates identity provider 
                    and custom roles: On the federated identity provider, 
                    give each federated user the roles defined by the 
                    StaffClassification field, part of the 
                    StaffEducationOrgAssignmentAssociation in the user's 
                    record in the inBloom data store. Update the custom 
                    roles to include the StaffClassification values as 
                    valid Role Names. For details about configuring custom 
                    roles, see 
                    <a href="https://inbloom.org/sites/default/files/docs-developer/doc-d6c53933-f760-494d-a52e-e1c68513eda2.html">Managing User Roles and Rights</a>

        <h2 id="resolvedIssues">Resolved Issues</h2>
        
        <p>
            The following is a list of previously reported issues which have
            been resolved this release.
        </p>
        
        <h3>DE840: inBloom data model does not account for Ed-Fi Core v. 1.0.03 version of Address with Country and AddressLine</h3>
        <p>
            The Address entity changed in EdFi 1.0.03 to have separate 
            structures to represent addresses that specify "Country" with 
            generic "AddressLine" values. Ingestion now accounts for this change. 
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="knownIssues">Known Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The following are the open defects currently used to track known 
            issues in this release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE198: EducationOrganization references to Program are not properly ingested.</h3>
        <p>
            The programReference is not yet implemented for 
            educationOrganization entities. As a result, the API does not 
            provide a link between educationOrganization and program entities.
        </p>
        <h3>DE273: A DisciplineDescriptor is not currently supported in Interchange-StudentDiscipline.</h3>
        <p>
            This descriptor is not currently supported. However, a 
            reference to this descriptor is required for the DisciplineAction
            entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE325: Global uniqueness of ProgramIdentifier is assumed when multiple EdOrgs can use the same IDs.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion process assumes that the Program ID is unique 
            within a tenant, but this should be unique within the specified 
            EdOrg instead. As a result, the reference could resolve incorrectly.
        </p>
        <h3>DE408: Aggregate Viewers cannot see themselves.</h3>
        <p>
            Users with the Aggregate Viewer role cannot see their own 
            Teacher or Staff entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE710: Section, school and session references in AttendanceEvent are ignored.</h3>
        <p>
            The way AttendanceEvent entities are handled ignores explicit 
            characterization of the attendance event - by school, section, 
            session. As a result, AttendanceEvents for students attending 
            multiple schools do not properly persist.
        </p>
        <h3>DE921: Duplicates are not reported.</h3>
        <p>
            Error reports are not always clear regarding the records 
            persisted. When there are duplicates within the XML file, or a 
            record already exists, the ingestion engine still updates the 
            record. However, this record count is not included in the 
            ingested records count.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1434: Internet Explorer 8 users may experience issues when using the dashboard builder.</h3>
        <p>
            If you are using Internet Explorer 8 and the dashboard builder, 
            then intermittently the release after a drag and drop does not 
            return the page to the correct state.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1457: Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error.</h3>
        <p>
            Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" 
            returns a 403 error. This error can cause the sectionInfo panel 
            to not display.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1458: The ingestion service is able to handle more than one teacher of record.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion service can accept more than one teacher for 
            a single section. The dashboard does not currently support 
            this behavior.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1573: Attendance Rate should be removed.</h3>
        <p>
            The current attendance record includes an attendance rate 
            column that may not be accurate for some use cases. The 
            column could be removed by default in a future release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1647: Dashboard may not display all data.</h3>
        <p>
            When a large dataset is available, the initial dashboard view 
            may only display a subset of the data. The dashboard currently 
            does not display a message explaining this scenario.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1728: An error occurs if an OAuth Callback URL does not begin with "HTTPS".</h3>
        <p>
            If an application includes a callback URL that does not begin 
            with "https://", then an error message is returned.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2079: HATEOS links don't always work as expected.</h3>
        <p>
            The HATEOS links that the API returns may not work as expected 
            in all cases. The contextual URI rewrites convert some API 
            requests. Some of these converted requests may not return 
            what is expected.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2160: Selecting a filter after listing a section removes all student data.</h3>
        <p>
            When viewing a list of students using the inBloom Dashboard, 
            choosing a filter related to that student's "special needs" 
            status results in a "no students found" error.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2300: There is a 250 result limit on global entities contained in elasticsearch.</h3>
        <p>
            When querying the following entities, results are limited to a 
            maximum of 250 returns:

        <h3>DE2725: Updating an entity does not correctly update the search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity 
            is not updated in elasticsearch and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2833: Deletes from Interchanges aside from InterchangeAssessmentMetadata does not work for ObjectiveAssessement and possibly others.</h3>
        <p>
            The Action Entity type can be present in any interchange 
            and should support deletion of any entity type. Currently, 
            the Action Entity with the type attribute set to DELETE will 
            only support deletion of entities within the interchange in 
            which the Action Entity is present. 
        </p>
        <h3>DE2851: Newly created student entity is unsearchable.</h3>
        <p>
            After creating a student entity, it cannot be retrieved from the 
            API endpoint.
        </p>

            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2853: Updating a learningStandard entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>

        <h2 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h2>
        <p> 
            Known limitations in this release are summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Landing Zone File Size Limit</strong> - 
                    Currently the Sandbox landing zones enforce a size 
                    limit of 5 MB for ingestion archive files, 
                    corresponding to approximately 150-25MB of 
                    uncompressed XML data, or about 150,000-250,000 
                    records. In this release, ingesting a data set of 
                    this size should take less than 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Unsupported Ed-Fi Entities</strong> - 
                    Some Ed-Fi entities are not yet supported and, thus, 
                    not consumable through data ingestion. For additional 
                    information, see the 
                    <a href="https://inbloom.org/library">inBloom Ingestion Guide</a>.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Educator Dashboard</strong> - 
                    Not all ingestible data is displayed in inBloom 
                    educator dashboards, including discipline incidents, 
                    cohorts or student competencies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Aggregate Viewer Roles</strong> - 
                    Aggregate Viewer roles do not yet provide aggregate 
                    view of data.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>API Custom Data Size Limit</strong> - 
                    Maximum currently enforced size of a custom data 
                    resource in API is 128KB. The theoretical maximum 
                    object size supported by the software platform is 
                    16MB, but a more practical restriction of 128KB has 
                    been placed on it in order to encourage efficient 
                    data management practices and application responsiveness. 
                    Custom data fields are not intended to be used to 
                    store multimedia content or other types of 
                    human-readable documents, for example. Such resources 
                    are better served through existing web-based 
                    infrastructure.
