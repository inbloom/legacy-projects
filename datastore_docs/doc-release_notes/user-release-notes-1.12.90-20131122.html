Make sure to use only artificial or fabricated data. inBloom provides fabricated sample data sets, available for download or as a selection when setting up your sandbox online.</p><hr /><h2 id="whatsNew">What's New?</h2><p><strong style="color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><em>Note: Beginning in Release Notes 1.12.90, issue numbers reference&nbsp;JIRA Product Backlog that can be accessed at:&nbsp;<a class="external-link" style="color: #326ca6;" href="https://support.inbloom.org/" rel="nofollow">https://support.inbloom.org/</a>.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Bulk Extract Updates:</h3><h3><strong>DS-674 Access non-enrolled student and staff data via Full and Delta Extract&nbsp;</strong></h3>If a student and/or staff member is no longer enrolled at an education organization, their data (and associated data: assessment, attendance, parent, etc.) captured during their enrollment period for the education organization will be accessible via full and delta extract. &nbsp;This behavior is in addition to the existing behavior that all data for current enrollment/associations with the education organization is accessible.<br /><h3>Application Authorization Updates:</h3><h3>DS-460 Delegation of Application Authorization removed</h3><p>UI components for the obsolete delegation of application authorization have been removed.</p><h3>DS-460 Application Authorization resource includes information regarding the last authorization</h3><p>Data regarding the last authorization including user and a timestamp are stored and returned.</p><h3>DS-460 Developer Enablement of Applications for Any Education Organization in the SEA Hierarchy</h3><p>With this release, developers now have the ability to enable an application for any education organization in any state education organization hierarchy via a tree control that has been added to the Edit Application page.</p><h3>DS-330 Hosted Admin Authorization of Applications for Any Education Organization in the Admin's Education Organization Hierarchy</h3><p>With this release, Hosted Admins (both SEA and LEA) now have the ability to authorize an application for any education organization in their education organization hierarchy via a tree control on the Application Authorization Dashboard page. &nbsp;Ability for Hosted LEA Admins to authorize applications was restored as part of this change.</p><p>Federated users may now be assigned the right to view security events through the API. The name of the right is SECURITY_EVENT_VIEW.</p><h2 id="dataModelUpdates">Data Model Updates</h2><h3><strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">DS-570 Multiple attendance events per student, school, school year, and event date supported&nbsp;</strong></h3>"AttendanceEventCategory" is now treated as a natural key field for attendance events. &nbsp;Prior to this release, only one attendance event per student, school, school year, and event date was allowed. &nbsp;Following this release, multiple events with the same student, school, school year, and event date will be supported if the attendance event category differs. &nbsp;The approach for implementing multiple events has been fully documented for API, Ingestion and Bulk Extract.<br /><h3><strong>DS-846 New GradeLevelType Enumeration</strong></h3>Added a new Grade Level Type for High School so that High School can be a GradeLevelType instead of choosing 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th Grades<br /><h3><strong>DS-847 "Attendance" is an added enumeration for AttendanceEventCategoryType</strong></h3><h2>Ingestion Schema Updates</h2><p>The following Ingestion Schema changes were made with this release:</p><ul><li>The natural key definition for the SLC-AttendanceEvent type now includes AttendanceEventCategory</li><li>An AttendanceEvenCategory element has been added to SLC-AttendanceEventIdentityType</li><li>Edited the GradeLevelType Enumeration to include High School as a GradeLevelType</li></ul><h2 id="apiUpdates">API Updates</h2><p>This release includes the following changes to the API:</p><ul><li><p>Bulk Extract was updated, Cohort is behaving as a public entity now.</p></li></ul><h3>Added</h3><p>There are no new API resources were added in this release.</p><h3>Deprecated</h3><p>No API resources were deprecated in this release.</p><h3>New and Updated Fields</h3><p>There are no additions or changes in the fields for existing API resources in this release.</p><h2 id="actionsRequiredOnUpdate">Actions Required on Update</h2><p>No action is required by users on update.</p><h2 id="resolvedIssues">Resolved Issues</h2><p>The following is a list of previously reported issues which have been resolved this release.</p><h3><strong>DS-804 - Two fields in TeacherSchoolAssociation aren't being ingested correctly</strong></h3>InstructionalGradeLevels and AcademicSubjects fields in TeacherSchoolAssociation aren't being ingested properly.<br /><h3><strong>DS-847 "Attendance" AttendanceEventCategoryType is missing</strong></h3>"Attendance" is an added enumeration for AttendanceEventCategoryType in the 1.0.03 version of the Ed-Fi schema.&nbsp;<br /><h3><strong>DS-848 Application Authorization throws error when SEA edOrg doesn't match</strong></h3>Error message should indicate that there is no Education Organization associated with the realm to which the user is logging in. This should generalize the error for all scenarios where an Admin user is attempting to log in where there is no valid realm/education organization association.<br /><h3><strong>DS-849 Unable to authorize Apps when edOrg directly associated to user not enabled</strong></h3>Expected behavior is for App to be displayed and when selected to display an edOrg tree with the SEA without a checkbox and only the enabled edOrgs with checkboxes.<br /><h3><strong>DS-850 Cancelling when on the App Enablement Page clears all enabled EdOrgs &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>Choosing "cancel" will not canuse EdOrgs array to be empty - should be the same as entering the page.<br /><h3><strong>DS-852: Synchronous Admin operations that update the same ldap can cause one to fail silently</strong></h3>An administrative user account will no longer be improperly created due to a concurrency issue.<br /><h3><strong>DS-853 Add documentation for undocumented control file flags</strong></h3>Documentation can be found here: <a style="line-height: 1.538em;" href="https://github.com/inbloomdev/datastore_docs/tree/master/doc-ingestion">datastore_docs/doc-ingestion</a><br /><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2 id="knownIssues">Known Issues</h2><p>The following are the open defects currently used to track known issues in this release.</p><h3>DS-778: EducationOrganization references to Program are not properly ingested.</h3><p>The programReference is not yet implemented for educationOrganization entities. As a result, the API does not provide a link between educationOrganization and program entities.</p><h3>DS-779: A DisciplineDescriptor is not currently supported in Interchange-StudentDiscipline.</h3><p>This descriptor is not currently supported. However, a reference to this descriptor is required for the DisciplineAction entity.</p><h3>DS-782: Global uniqueness of ProgramIdentifier is assumed when multiple EdOrgs can use the same IDs.</h3><p>The ingestion process assumes that the Program ID is unique within a tenant, but this should be unique within the specified EdOrg instead. As a result, the reference could resolve incorrectly.</p><h3>DE-408: Aggregate Viewers cannot see themselves.</h3><p>Users with the Aggregate Viewer role cannot see their own Teacher or Staff entity.</p><h3>DS-784: Section, school and session references in AttendanceEvent are ignored.</h3><p>The way AttendanceEvent entities are handled ignores explicit characterization of the attendance event - by school, section, session. As a result, AttendanceEvents for students attending multiple schools do not properly persist.</p><h3>DS-787: Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error.</h3><p>Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error. This error can cause the sectionInfo panel to not display.</p><h3>DS-780: An error occurs if an OAuth Callback URL does not begin with "HTTPS".</h3><p>If an application includes a callback URL that does not begin with "https://", then an error message is returned.</p><h3>DS-781: HATEOS links don't always work as expected.</h3><p>The HATEOS links that the API returns may not work as expected in all cases. The contextual URI rewrites convert some API requests. Some of these converted requests may not return what is expected.</p><h3>DS-792: There is a 250 result limit on global entities contained in elasticsearch.</h3><p>When querying the following entities, results are limited to a maximum of 250 returns:</p><p>/assessments</p><p>/competencyLevelDescriptor</p><p>/learningObjectives</p><p>/learningStandards</p><p>/studentCompetencyObjectives</p><h3>DS-793: Deletes from Interchanges aside from InterchangeAssessmentMetadata does not work for ObjectiveAssessement and possibly others.</h3><p>The Action Entity type can be present in any interchange and should support deletion of any entity type. Currently, the Action Entity with the type attribute set to DELETE will only support deletion of entities within the interchange in which the Action Entity is present.</p><h3>DS-794: Newly created student entity is unsearchable.</h3><p>After creating a student entity, it cannot be retrieved from the API endpoint.</p><h3>DS-795: Updating a learningObjective entity does not correctly update search index.</h3><p>When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.</p><h3>DS-796: Updating a learningStandard entity does not correctly update search index.</h3><p>When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.</p><h3>DS-797: Updating a courseOffering entity does not correctly update search index.</h3><p>When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.</p><h3>DS-798: Delta bulk extract behavior is incorrect for force delete of Assessment followed by an ObjectiveAssessment update in the same delta interval.</h3><p>There is a condition where "AssessmentItem", "ObjectiveAssessment", "StudentAssessmentItem", or "StudentObjectiveAssessment" instances refer to a parent entity instance that does not exist in the data store (because of forced deletion of that entity or out of order ingestion). If these dependent entities are updated, then a "hollow" parent entity which includes the dependent entity instance data is included in the bulk extract. The correct behavior is that there is no entry in the bulk extract when the referred to entity instance does not exist.</p><h3>NEW! DS-854 &nbsp;Uncaught EntityNotFoundException if Student has no association to cohorts or programs</h3><p>When a student is not associated to a cohort or program, result: an uncaught EntityNotFoundException.</p><h3>NEW! DS-855 Admin Tool Saves Realm Edit Values, Even On Errors</h3><p>The Realm Edit page of the Admin Tool will allow saving of error values in the database.</p><h3>NEW! DS-851 ApplicationAuthorization List API endpoint does not display edOrg information</h3><p>applicationAuthorization endpoint (without specifying an id) displays below, note edOrgs are not displayed</p><h3>NEW! DS-856 Attendance API does not support PUT/PATCH</h3><p>The update of sub elements in a top level element does not behave as expected under REST PUT and PATCH methods.</p><h3>NEW! DS-857 &nbsp;The public data extract's endpoint returns an error message if no top level LEAs are authorized for that app</h3><p>If a bulk extract app is authorized for some education organizations, but not for any of the LEAs directly underneath the SEA, (for example, a school under a top level district is authorized to use the application but not the district itself) then an authorized user tries to retrieve the extracts via the API, the public data extract's endpoint returns an error message.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id="webBrowserCompatibility">Web Browser Compatibility</h2><p>inBloom technology Dashboard is best viewed in Internet Explorer 8+, Firefox 6+, Safari 4+ with 1024x768 as the minimum recommended screen resolution.</p><h2 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h2><p>Known limitations in this release are summarized as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Landing Zone File Size Limit</strong> - Currently the Sandbox landing zones enforce a size limit of 5 MB for ingestion archive files, corresponding to approximately 150-25MB of uncompressed XML data, or about 150,000-250,000 records. In this release, ingesting a data set of this size should take less than 5 minutes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unsupported Ed-Fi Entities</strong> - Some Ed-Fi entities are not yet supported and, thus, not consumable through data ingestion. For additional information, see the <a href="https://inbloom.org/library">inBloom Ingestion Guide</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Educator Dashboard</strong> - Not all ingestible data is displayed in inBloom educator dashboards, including discipline incidents, cohorts or student competencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aggregate Viewer Roles</strong> - Aggregate Viewer roles do not yet provide aggregate view of data.</p></li><li><p><strong>API Custom Data Size Limit</strong> - Maximum currently enforced size of a custom data resource in API is 128KB. The theoretical maximum object size supported by the software platform is 16MB, but a more practical restriction of 128KB has been placed on it in order to encourage efficient data management practices and application responsiveness. Custom data fields are not intended to be used to store multimedia content or other types of human-readable documents, for example. Such resources are better served through existing web-based infrastructure.</p></li></ul><div class="footer"><p>Copyright © 2013 inBloom, Inc. and its affiliates.</p><p>This document and the information contained herein is provided on an "AS IS" basis and inBloom, Inc.
