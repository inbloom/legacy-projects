            The inBloom sandbox environment MUST NOT contain real data,
            including educational records or personally identifiable 
            information (PII) for students or educators. Make sure to 
            use only artificial or fabricated data. inBloom provides

        <h3>New Security Event Available from API</h3>
        <p>
            "Access denied" events that occur in the API now generate 
            security events that are viewable using the 
            <em>securityEvent</em> system resource. See the 
            <a href="https://inbloom.org/sites/default/files/docs-developer/c-api-app_functions-security_admin.html"><em>securityEvent</em> resource listing</a> 
            for more information.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Update in API Resources Permissions</h3>
        <p>
            Some REST API resources now perform CRUD operations based on 
            the user's permission by education organization. See
            <a href="#apiUpdates">API Updates</a> below for more details.

        <h2 id="resolvedIssues">Resolved Issues</h2>
        
        <p>
            The following is a list of previously reported issues which have
            been resolved this release.
        </p>
        
        <h3>DE2893: Escaped greater-than and less-than characters are triggering the blacklist.</h3>
        <p>
            Greater-than (&gt;) and less-than (&lt;) characters are removed 
            from the blacklist with this release.
        </p>
        
        <h3>DE2932: Security events API resource not taking into account TenantId.</h3>
        <p>
            When using the <em>securityEvents</em> system resource in the API, 
            LEA and SEA administrators now see only the security events for 
            their tenant, even if an identically named education organizations
            exists in other tenants.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="knownIssues">Known Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The following are the open defects currently used to track known 
            issues in this release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE198: EducationOrganization references to Program are not properly ingested.</h3>
        <p>
            The programReference is not yet implemented for 
            educationOrganization entities. As a result, the API does not 
            provide a link between educationOrganization and program entities.
        </p>
        <h3>DE273: A DisciplineDescriptor is not currently supported in Interchange-StudentDiscipline.</h3>
        <p>
            This descriptor is not currently supported. However, a 
            reference to this descriptor is required for the DisciplineAction
            entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE325: Global uniqueness of ProgramIdentifier is assumed when multiple EdOrgs can use the same IDs.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion process assumes that the Program ID is unique 
            within a tenant, but this should be unique within the specified 
            EdOrg instead. As a result, the reference could resolve incorrectly.
        </p>
        <h3>DE408: Aggregate Viewers cannot see themselves.</h3>
        <p>
            Users with the Aggregate Viewer role cannot see their own 
            Teacher or Staff entity.
        </p>
        <h3>DE710: Section, school and session references in AttendanceEvent are ignored.</h3>
        <p>
            The way AttendanceEvent entities are handled ignores explicit 
            characterization of the attendance event - by school, section, 
            session. As a result, AttendanceEvents for students attending 
            multiple schools do not properly persist.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1434: Internet Explorer 8 users may experience issues when using the dashboard builder.</h3>
        <p>
            If you are using Internet Explorer 8 and the dashboard builder, 
            then intermittently the release after a drag and drop does not 
            return the page to the correct state.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1457: Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" returns a 403 error.</h3>
        <p>
            Making a teacher call for a section with two "teachers of record" 
            returns a 403 error. This error can cause the sectionInfo panel 
            to not display.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1458: The ingestion service is able to handle more than one teacher of record.</h3>
        <p>
            The ingestion service can accept more than one teacher for 
            a single section. The dashboard does not currently support 
            this behavior.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1573: Attendance Rate should be removed.</h3>
        <p>
            The current attendance record includes an attendance rate 
            column that may not be accurate for some use cases. The 
            column could be removed by default in a future release.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1647: Dashboard may not display all data.</h3>
        <p>
            When a large dataset is available, the initial dashboard view 
            may only display a subset of the data. The dashboard currently 
            does not display a message explaining this scenario.
        </p>
        <h3>DE1728: An error occurs if an OAuth Callback URL does not begin with "HTTPS".</h3>
        <p>
            If an application includes a callback URL that does not begin 
            with "https://", then an error message is returned.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2079: HATEOS links don't always work as expected.</h3>
        <p>
            The HATEOS links that the API returns may not work as expected 
            in all cases. The contextual URI rewrites convert some API 
            requests. Some of these converted requests may not return 
            what is expected.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2160: Selecting a filter after listing a section removes all student data.</h3>
        <p>
            When viewing a list of students using the inBloom Dashboard, 
            choosing a filter related to that student's "special needs" 
            status results in a "no students found" error.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2300: There is a 250 result limit on global entities contained in elasticsearch.</h3>
        <p>
            When querying the following entities, results are limited to a 
            maximum of 250 returns:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>/assessments</p></li>
            <li><p>/competencyLevelDescriptor</p></li>
            <li><p>/learningObjectives</p></li>
            <li><p>/learningStandards</p></li>
            <li><p>/studentCompetencyObjectives</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DE2725: Updating an entity does not correctly update the search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity 
            is not updated in elasticsearch and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2833: Deletes from Interchanges aside from InterchangeAssessmentMetadata does not work for ObjectiveAssessement and possibly others.</h3>
        <p>
            The Action Entity type can be present in any interchange 
            and should support deletion of any entity type. Currently, 
            the Action Entity with the type attribute set to DELETE will 
            only support deletion of entities within the interchange in 
            which the Action Entity is present. 
        </p>
        <h3>DE2851: Newly created student entity is unsearchable.</h3>
        <p>
            After creating a student entity, it cannot be retrieved from the 
            API endpoint.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2852: Updating a learningObjective entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2853: Updating a learningStandard entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2857: Updating a courseOffering entity does not correctly update search index.</h3>
        <p>
            When an existing entity in the system is updated, that entity is 
            not updated in elastic search and becomes unsearchable.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2914: Delta bulk extract behavior is incorrect for force delete of Assessment followed by an ObjectiveAssessment update in the same delta interval.</h3>
        <p>
            There is a condition where "AssessmentItem", "ObjectiveAssessment", 
            "StudentAssessmentItem", or "StudentObjectiveAssessment" instances 
            refer to a parent entity instance that does not exist in the data 
            store (because of forced deletion of that entity or out of order 
            ingestion). If these dependent entities are updated, then a 
            "hollow" parent entity which includes the dependent entity instance 
            data is included in the bulk extract. The correct behavior is 
            that there is no entry in the bulk extract when the referred to 
            entity instance does not exist.
        </p>
        <h3>DE2930: Total count being returned in API header is incorrect.</h3>
        <p>
            This case surfaces entities that have been enabled for contextual
            roles and the user has different roles in different edorgs.

                    limit of 5 MB for ingestion archive files, 
                    corresponding to approximately 150-25MB of 
                    uncompressed XML data, or about 150,000-250,000 
                    records. In this release, ingesting a data set of 
                    this size should take less than 5 minutes.

                    <strong>Unsupported Ed-Fi Entities</strong> - 
                    Some Ed-Fi entities are not yet supported and, thus, 
                    not consumable through data ingestion. For additional 
                    information, see the 
                    <a href="https://inbloom.org/library">inBloom Ingestion Guide</a>.

                    <strong>Educator Dashboard</strong> - 
                    Not all ingestible data is displayed in inBloom 
                    educator dashboards, including discipline incidents, 
                    cohorts or student competencies.

                    <strong>API Custom Data Size Limit</strong> - 
                    Maximum currently enforced size of a custom data 
                    resource in API is 128KB. The theoretical maximum 
                    object size supported by the software platform is 
                    16MB, but a more practical restriction of 128KB has 
                    been placed on it in order to encourage efficient 
                    data management practices and application responsiveness. 
                    Custom data fields are not intended to be used to 
                    store multimedia content or other types of 
                    human-readable documents, for example. Such resources 
                    are better served through existing web-based 
                    infrastructure.
