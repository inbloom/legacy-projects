buildlist.sh:
The buildlist.sh script uses the slc_rest_api_resources.xml file to build 
a plain text, whitespace free list of the endpoints available in the that 
release of the product API. 

The script must be run in the same directory as the 
slc_rest_api_resources.xml file. The resulting output of this script is 
endpoint_list.txt

APIcompare.sh:
The APIcompare.sh script compares two endpoint lists 
(generated by buildlist.sh). The script is expecting two files: 
endpoint_list.txt and endpoint_list_old.txt and must be run in the same 
directory as those files. The output either confirms that the lists are the 
same or announces the files are different.

New_vs_Old.sh:
The New_vs_Old.sh script parses two lists of endpoints and reports the 
differences.  The script is expecting two files: endpoint_list.txt and 
endpoint_list_old.txt and must be run in the same directory as those 
files. Endpoints that appear only in endpoint_lists.txt are marked as 
having been added or changed. Endpoints that appear only in 
endpoint_lists_old.txt are marked as having been deleted or changed. 
The output is displayed to the screen and is stored in api_changes.txt 
which is created in the same directory.
