gr.py
-----
Python script that makes a series of GET requests using the URIs in
the SLI REST API. Use the following format when calling the command:

  python gr.py <urls-file> <actual-base-url> <print-base-url> <oauth-token>

In the command above:
* urls-file = the path and filename of the list of partial URIs,
              which is the portion of the URI that makes it unique
              within the API
* actual-base-url = the string to append to the beginning of each
                    partial URI from urls-file to direct the request
                    to a specific SLI data source
* print-base-url = the string to append to the bevinning of each
                   partial URI from urls-file when printing the URI
                   used in each example
* oauth-token = the token returned after authenticating to the target
                database
